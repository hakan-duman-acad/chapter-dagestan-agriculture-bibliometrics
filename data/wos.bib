Abstract = {Individual household plot was and is one of the most common forms of
   organization of agricultural production in Dagestan, which provides
   employment in a labor-surplus region, as well as the income growth for
   rural residents of the southern region. In the 60-80s of the twentieth
   century individual household plots retained their significance despite
   the criticism and certain administrative obstacles, the rhetoric about
   the ``withering away{''} of individual household plots and the primacy
   of social production. In some industries individual household plots
   received their further development, especially after the enaction of
   certain decrees and orders in 1964, 1965, 1977 that reduced the pressure
   on the villagers who had household plots. There was the growth of
   sheepheads, especially in mountainous areas, the reactivation of farms,
   and the slow expansion of land for individual household plots. They had
   the trade growth in agriculture and its geographical expansion. It was
   noted that the commercial orientation of individual household plots was
   higher than in social farms, their material and labor costs paid off due
   to higher incomes. Such incomes were provided by the production of those
   products that were produced by little or not produced by collective and
   state farms, and therefore products were in great demand. The difficulty
   of collecting statistical data on the development of individual plots
   was noted, since they were rarely cited in statistical compilations. (C)

Title = {Holocene environmental history and populating of mountainous Dagestan

Journal = {QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2019},

Number = {SI},
Pages = {111-126},

Abstract = {The mountainous Dagestan region has a unique historical development,
   likely based in independent cereal domestication and terraced
   agriculture. However, there is little to no data on the nature and
   timing of environmental changes throughout the settlement history of
   this region. In contrast to the much studied neighboring Caucasus
   regions, Dagestan remains mostly unexplored from the standpoint of
   paleoecology. Here we present a detailed radiocarbon-dated 185 cm long
   pollen record from the Shotota swamp located in the mountainous zone of
   the Eastern Caucasus (Dagestan). Peat and soil deposits of the swamp
   span most of the Holocene from the Neolithic to the Middle Ages, and
   this study, for the first time, presents an analysis of Holocene
   vegetation history and the populating of the Eastern Caucasus.
   Our analysis reveals three basic stages of transformation of natural
   conditions: a stage of predominantly warm and dry climate, open meadow
   and steppe landscapes of 9200-7300 BP associated with the Neolithic
   period; a warm and humid climate of 7300-6000 BP which accompanied the
   appearance of deciduous forests in the Chalcolithic period; and cooling
   and several phases of humidification oscillations with the constant rise
   of pine forests with 5000 BP, which are associated with the Bronze Age,
   Early Iron Age and Middle Ages. With the data obtained on the dynamics
   of vegetation, we conducted a coupled analysis of climate dynamics,
   populating and economy in Dagestan. The results of the study show
   significant discrepancies in the timing and sequence of the expansion of
   tree species in the Holocene in comparison with Transcaucasia and the
   Western Caucasus. Despite the low settlement density pollen results
   reveal signs of agricultural development in the Khunzakh plateau in the
   Chalcolithic, the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age that are not
   documented in archaeological surveys and require further investigation.},

Abstract = {Materials are presented for route, stationary soil, and ecological
   studies carried out in the high-mountainous zone of Dagestan with the
   characteristics of (a) the modern features of the development of the
   soil cover and (b) the ecological parameters of the soil cover and their
   changes under the influence of climatic warming. The variety of natural
   and economic conditions of the object of study resulted in significant
   diversity of the soil cover. The soil distribution was greatly
   influenced by the terrain height and the exposure and steepness of
   slopes. Based on soil erosion studies from previous periods, it can be
   noted that improper land use and climatic warming have led to radical
   changes in the composition of the soil cover in terms of defining
   indicators-soil erosion. In recent years, the area of eroded land has
   doubled, and the area with heavily eroded soils has increased by a
   third. This led to a decrease in the thickness of humus horizons in
   almost all soils to an average of 20 cm, and the loss of humus reserves
   in soils amounted to 60\% of the original content. The presented
   analysis of soil-cover degradation and the established patterns of soil
   evolution on the slope lands of high mountains serve as a theoretical
   basis for the reproduction of soil fertility and preservation of the
   ecological role of soil protection from erosion and other degradation
   processes.},

Abstract = {A positive effect of irrigation of meadow-chestnut soil on soil
   fertility was described for the dry-steppe zone of Dagestan. The object
   of research was tomatoes (Gift variety) planted on irrigated lands of
   Dagestan. The subject of research is tillage and irrigation methods. The
   influence of agrotechnical methods on agrophysical soil properties,
   level and quality of tomatoes was determined. Maintaining the moisture
   of the active soil layer within 80...100 \% NV can optimize agrophysical
   fertility indicators of the meadow-chestnut soil. In combination with
   tillage at a depth of 0.23...0.25 m, it ensures the tomato yield of
   80...86 t/ha.},

Abstract = {This ethnographic essay investigates the relations between past and
   present forms of Islam in the north Caucasian Republic of Daghestan.
   Conversations culled from fieldwork in Daghestani urban and rural spaces
   are used to elucidate the cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity
   of life in this region. Ethnographies in a bookstore, a shrine to the
   Imam Shamil, and a scholarly archive in Makhachkala unfold against the
   historical background of Daghestan's long-standing encounter with the
   Arabo-Islamic world. The essay explores how the post-Soviet turn to
   post-secular Islam represents an alternative to colonialism and a new
   way of making meaning in the present. It is intended as a contribution
   to Islamic studies, modernity theory, and post-Soviet Union area
   studies.},

Title = {ON THE QUESTION OF THE REVIVAL OF THE ANCIENT MOUNTAIN VILLAGES (AULS)
   OF DAGHESTAN},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-29},
Abstract = {Aim. The aim of the research is to analyze the reasons for the migration
   of mountain people to the plain, the identification of the most
   significant stages of the resettlement movement in the Republic of
   Dagestan, the identification of ways to preserve and revive the mountain
   villages of Dagestan. Discussion. At present, the outflow of population
   from mountainous areas to flat land is actively continuing which leads
   to the abandonment of dozens of mountain villages. Therefore, in modern
   conditions, the urgent task is to preserve and revive the mountain
   villages of Dagestan. For this, first of all, the creation of a
   developed infrastructure, high-quality medical care and education, as
   well as the revival of traditional forms of land use, horticulture and
   cattle breeding, creation of new jobs are necessary in mountainous
   areas. The traditional habitat should be attractive for young people.
   The understanding of the problem of preservation and revival of the
   mountainous regions of Dagestan exists not only at the governmental
   level but also in Dagestan society as a whole. It is shown that the
   natural-historical and cultural complexes of Dagestan should be used for
   the development of various types of tourism, especially
   cultural-cognitive and ethno-tourism, ecological and religious tourism.
   Conclusion. Almost every ancient mountain village of Dagestan is
   actually an ethnographic museum in the open air, therefore the
   development of the tourism industry, in particular cultural-cognitive
   and ethno-tourism, will contribute to the preservation and revival of
   ancient auls in the republic.},

Abstract = {Traditional forms of marriage and wedding rituals of the peoples of
   Dagestan have always been the object of attention and study of
   ethnographers. However, it was often studied only the wedding and
   rituals of the rural population, when urban rites and forms of marriage
   are poorly described. In addition, the socio-economic, political,
   ideological and other changes that have occurred in the region in recent
   times have made certain adjustments and transformations in family and
   marriage relations. Modern forms and conditions of marriage in the
   cities of Dagestan differ in many respects from the old ones, and some
   archaic forms do not occur today at all.},

Title = {New Carabid Species (<i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Carabidae</i>) for the Fauna
   of Dagestan},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {173-181},
Abstract = {Aim. To present new data on the distribution of Carabid species in
   Dagestan, Russia.
   Material and Methods. The paper is based on material collected in the
   lowland areas of Dagestan. Conventional sampling techniques were used:
   hand collecting, UV light traps and pitfall traps.
   Results. The three following species of Carabidae have been found in
   Dagestan for the first time: Poecilus (s. str.) anodon (Chaudoir, 1868),
   Pterostichus (Platysma) planicollis (Tschischerine, 1898) and
   Diplocheila (Isorembus) transcaspica (Semenov, 1891), with the latter
   being a new species for the fauna of Russia. New distributional records
   have been mapped. Photographs of all three species are provided.
   Conclusion. These new distributional data are unlikely to be explained
   within the context of global warming since, for two of the three species
   under consideration, Poecilus anodon and Pterostichus planicollis, the
   ranges of distribution are located largely north of the study area.},

Abstract = {Studies of multilingual systems found in Indigenous small-scale
   communities often assume that exogamous marriages are the norm in such
   societies and contribute to their linguistic diversity. This paper is an
   account of the language ideology of endogamous societies in rural
   highland Daghestan (Northeast Caucasus). By studying language policing
   and language choice in infrequent mixed marriages, the paper uncovers
   the beliefs that support endogamy and reveals issues of linguistic
   identity and attitudes toward the usage of the matrilect within the
   family and the village. Interviews show that in-married women do not
   bring new languages to the villages, because they quickly acquire the
   local language new to them and use it with all their in-laws and their
   children. A strong association between villages and languages together
   with the ideology supporting linguistic homogeneity within the village
   contributes to the maintenance of the regional linguistic diversity.},

   (Ortoklinskoye) Gotsatlinskoye burial ground located in Mountainous
   Dagestan and dating back to the 10th-12th centuries. Based on the
   results of intragroup and intergroup comparisons, a conclusion is made
   about the differences between this sample and known paleoanthropological
   series from the territory of North Ossetia, Ingushetia, Chechnya,
   Dagestan and Georgia. The reason for this difference is a strong
   morphological heterogeneity, which, taking into account the
   peculiarities of the archaeological material, allows us to conclude that
   this burial ground was a necropolis of a Lag farm (captives, a group of
   the population with limited rights).},

Abstract = {The results of the clinical and epidemiological study of epilepsy in the
   Soviet region of Makhachkala city and the Khasavurt region of the
   Dagestan Republic are presented. The sample size was 139.115 in the
   Soviet region and 101.278 in the Khasavurt region, The samples included
   344 and 338 patients with epilepsy, respectively. The age- and sex-
   standardized prevalence of epilepsy was 2.06 (CI95\% 1.80-2.32) cases
   per 1000 population in the Soviet region and 2.98 (CI95\% 2.60-3.35)
   cases per 1000 population in the Khasavurt region (p=0.05). The
   prevalence of epilepsy was higher in men. Focal (location-related) forms
   of epilepsy were most frequent, with the highest frequency of partial
   seizures with secondary generalization. Cranial-brain injury, intra- and
   perinatal pathology and cerebral vascular diseases were the main causes
   of the development of focal epilepsies. Seizure frequency greater than
   12 per year was noted in more than a half of patients. The study of
   social aspects showed that only small portion of patients worked, most
   of patients received disability pensions. Differences in the education
   level were identified as well.},

Title = {Ethnicity and fertility of descendants of rural-to-urban migrants: the

Abstract = {This paper studies ethnic differences in the fertility of the
   descendants of migrants in a highly polyethnic region of Russia,
   Dagestan (North Caucasus). That region gives a rather rare example of an
   urban population whose majority is formed by migrants and their second-
   and third-generation descendants of several ethnicities which differ in
   fertility in their rural places of origin. We take the opportunity to
   consider the key hypotheses on the fertility of the descendants of
   migrants in this rather non-standard setting. The central question we
   address is whether the ethnic differences in fertility observed among
   rural residents are also passed on to descendants of rural-to-urban
   migrants. Another question concerns the role of education in preserving
   vs. weakening ethnic differences in fertility between descendants of
   migrants. We analyze the Russian population census 2010 data on the
   region under study, running Poisson models for the total number of
   children and logistic models for progressions to different parities. Our
   main conclusion is that ethnic differences in fertility remain
   significant among descendants of rural-to-urban migrants. Arguably, this
   supports the socialization hypothesis, because contacts between
   co-ethnics are intensive in the region and interethnic marriages are
   rather infrequent, which helps young urban people to adopt patterns of
   reproductive behavior typical for their ethnicity. Among highly educated
   women, however, the ethnic differences in fertility are weaker, which
   might be related to the ease in the departure of such women from
   fertility trajectories of their co-ethnics.},

Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Aim. To carry out an ecological and faunistic review of weevils of the
   tribe Baridini Schoencherr, 1836 of Dagestan; study of the ecology and
   chorology of the most harmful species, the green rutabaga baride
   (Aulacobaris coerulescens Scop.).
   Material and Methods. The work was based on observations and materials
   obtained in 1996-2020 in various regions of Dagestan, using classical
   methods of field study of invertebrates. Collection materials and data
   from different authors for the period from 1872 to 2010 were also used.
   Stationary studies of the ecology of Aulacobaris coerulescens Scopoli,
   1763 were conducted on the basis of agricultural cooperatives and
   peasant farms of Buynaksky, Levashinsky, Akushinsky and Gergebilsky
   districts of Dagestan.
   Results. Studies have shown that the fauna of the tribe Baridini in
   Dagestan is represented by 26 species from 8 genera. In zoogeographic
   terms, it is composed of 7 complexes with the main core being formed by
   steppe species. In the attitudinal range, the fauna of lowland Dagestan
   is the richest, where 20 species live. Trophic specialization is
   dominated by broad oligophages; the main food base is the Brassicaceae
   family. The most important agricultural species and dangerous pest of
   cabbage in Dagestan is the green rutabaga baride (Aulacoboris
   coerulescens Scopoli, 1763). The features of its ecology and
   distribution were studied and a phenological table and a map of the
   range were compiled.
   Conclusion. The fauna of the Baridini tribe of Dagestan is rich and
   varied. It is represented by various zoogeographical and ecological
   complexes in all attitudinal zones of Dagestan. Phenological data and a
   distribution map of rutabaga baride can be used to optimize control
   measures and minimize impacts on ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Aim. Based on original and bibliographic data, to compile a review of
   the fauna of gall midges in Dagestan, Russia, including information
   about host plants, gall formation, life cycles and distribution.
   Materials and Methods. The basis for the work were materials collected
   in the flat and mountainous parts of Dagestan. Standard methods were
   used: inspection of the plants, search and mass collection of galls and
   damage to plants in which larvae develop; rearing imago; making
   permanent preparations of larvae and adults.
   Results. For the first time, an overview of the gall midges of Dagestan
   is offered. 67 species of gall midges of 41 genera were identified, of
   which 39 species are new to Dagestan, including 13 species new to the
   Caucasus: Asphondylia hornigi Wachtl, 1880, A. menthae Kieffer, 1902, A.
   salviaflorae Fedotova, 2003, Lasioptera eryngii (ValIot, 1829), Rosomyia

   Dasineura plicatrix (Loew, 1850), D. sisymbrii (Schrank, 1803), D.
   trifolii (Low, 1874), D. tamaricicarpa Fedotova, 1983, Asiodiplosis
   hodukini Marikovskij, 1965, A. petrosimoniae (Fedotova, 1994),
   Seriphidomyia butakovi Fedotova, 2000. Of these the last 4 are new to
   Russia. Phytophage gall midges (64 species of 36 genera) were found on
   plants belonging to 23 families, 46 genera and 56 species. Of the 36
   genera of gall midges, 28 (77.8\%) are plant-specific to plant families,
   including 9 out of 28 (32.1\%) monotypic. The fauna is based on the
   Western Palearctic and Turanian species.
   Conclusion. A preliminary review of gall midges in Dagestan in
   comparison with data on adjacent territories, indicates a very poor
   study of gall midges in general. Identification of the species diversity
   and trophic relationships of gall midges which develop on adventitious,
   invasive and economically important plants of the Caucasus is relevant
   both for protected natural areas and recreational areas.},

Abstract = {Aim. The aim of the research was to improve the elements of
   agro-technology for cultivating new high-yielding varieties of winter
   wheat under conditions of the plain zone irrigation depending on the
   doses and the terms of introducing mineral nitrogen-phosphorus
   fertilizers. Methods. Research was carried out on chestnut heavy loamy
   soils. Sampling of soils and plants, as well as agro-chemical properties
   of soils were determined according to standard generally accepted
   methods. Mathematical processing of data on the yield of cereals was
   carried out by analysis-of-variance method using computer technology.
   Results. Our studies showed that the most productive of the studied
   varieties was Grom, which, on average for three years (2012-2015) gave a
   grain yield of 7.6 t/ha with nitrogen-phosphorus fertilizers introduced
   at a dose of N180P100 against 5.6 t/ha in a similar version to the
   control during sowing of the Tanya variety. Vassa and Sila varieties
   were also inferior to Grom variety for yields, respectively, by 1.1 t/ha
   and 1.4 t / ha. It was also revealed that with the Grom variety, when
   applying an increased dose of mineral fertilizers (N180P100), on average
   for three years, the best indicators were by the area of the leaf
   surface (63.6 thousand m(2)/ha), photosynthetic index of crops was
   2765.6 thousand m(2)/ha and net productivity of photosynthesis was 6.3
   g/m(2), day. For other varieties of winter wheat and doses of mineral
   fertilizers, these indicators were lower. Conclusion. In steady-state
   experiment, when studying the potential of new high-yielding varieties
   of winter wheat at different levels and times of introducing mineral
   nutrition, the Grom variety showed the best yields.},

Abstract = {Research of the issues of preservation the traditional culture of the
   peoples of the Russian Federation, especially Dagestan, in the process
   of integration with neighboring state formations in 1990-2010 is one of
   the most important directions in the formation of a modern state
   strategy to preserve the linguistic and cultural wealth of Russia. The
   relevance of the study is due to the need to carefully study the
   processes of integration of Dagestan into the common space of Russia,
   transformation of its traditional foundations under the influence of the
   globalization and russification processes and their results. The main
   purpose of this paper is a brief analysis of the current state of
   traditional culture and daily life of the peoples of Dagestan and its
   transformation under the influence of Russian and world cultures, as
   well as of the global information openness in 1991-2000. On the basis of
   field ethnographic material, non-fiction, periodicals, sociology
   opinions and data on the Internet in the article traced the
   transformation of the external appearance of the inhabitants of the
   Dagestan, their houses, national cuisine, the ways of the celebration
   associated with the traditional spiritual life and others. The
   prerequisites and reasons for these changes are revealed, concrete ways
   of cultural transfer of Russian, European and eastern traditions to
   Dagestan, and the degree of exposure to their globalization are also
   discovered.
   It is also noted that the loss of the traditional heritage of the
   Dagestan peoples is associated with an increase in the level mobility
   among the middle generation and youth in educational, labor and leisure,
   as well as the transfer of cultural values they perceived in foreign
   countries and the subsequent replacement of their own. This leads to the
   upbringing by cultural migrants of new generation of children in
   accordance with Russian or European cultural standards. The main reason
   for this is an attempt to facilitate the further integration of
   adolescents and young people into the globalizing world. In addition,
   the process of polarization of the Dagestan society in the field of
   spiritual heritage transfer has been revealed. On the one hand, they
   raise their children mainly within the framework of the Dagestan
   traditions, strengthened by Islamic views (in some cases they turn into
   the extreme degree of Muslim radicalism), and on the other hand -
   European and Russian etiquette and culture (they often completely
   perceive their norms of morality, behavior, etc.). Moreover, the second
   group has a significant advantage, and consequently, is the source of
   innovative ideas that lead to oblivion of the traditional foundations of
   the life of the Dagestanis and the deformation of the national
   mentality.
   It is emphasized that despite the intensive introduction of cultural and
   other innovations in post-Soviet times, the modern urban and especially
   rural population of Dagestan is trying to preserve a number of
   components of its traditional material and spiritual culture.},

Title = {TO THE FAUNA OF TICKS OF THE REPUBLIC OF DAGHESTAN},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {43-51},
Abstract = {Aim. The human factor has a significant influence on the development
   cycles of flora and fauna in the republic, including ticks, in which
   life cycles are associated with parasitization of agricultural animals,
   where biotopes are farm buildings, virgin and fallow pastures. Global
   changes in agriculture over the past two decades have led to an increase
   in natural pastures, reduction in the areas of sowing grasses, an
   increase in biotope areas and a number of parasitic ticks on animals. In
   this regard, we set a goal to study the ecological and biological
   features of the distribution of biotopes of arthropod parasites in the
   republic. Material and methods. The material of the study was ticks
   collected from cattle, sheep and horses in various zones. Collection of
   ticks was carried out by epizootic and regular methods. Observations,
   using the direct collection method, have been carried out for 7 years.
   Results. The researches revealed the presence of 4 genera of Ixodes
   ticks in the Republic: Hyalomma, Boophilus, Rhipicephalus and
   Dermacentor, and the genus Hyalomma occurs mainly in the Tersko-Sulak
   lowland, the rest can be discovered throughout the territory of
   Chechnya. Their species composition is represented by H. scupense, H.
   anatolicum, H. marginatum, H. plumbeum; B. annulatus; D. reticulatus, D.
   marginatus, D. daghestanicus and R. bursa. Conclusion. Through the
   infected eggs of the tick, further infection of the larvae takes place,
   which in turn, after molting, turn into the nymph and infect healthy
   animals, as well as the adult. The natural and climatic conditions of
   the Republic favor such a cycle of development of ticks.},

Abstract = {Aim. To identify complexes of gall-forming insects and mites in the
   fauna of Dagestan, which, together with other inhabitants of galls, are
   evolutionarily associated with common plant species and genera.
   Materials and Methods. The materials were collected in the plains and
   mountains of Dagestan. Standard methods were used: inspection of plants,
   search and mass collection of galls; breeding imago and production of
   preparations of larvae and adults.
   Results. Assemblages of gall midges (Diptera, Cecidomyiidae), gall wasps
   (Hymenoptera, Cynipidae), psyllids, aphids (Hemiptera, Aphalaridae,
   Psyllidae, Aphididae) and gall four-legged mites (Acari, Eriophyidae)
   dominate. Additionally, for the fauna of Dagestan, 7 species of 5 genera
   Eriophyidae and 24 species of 12 genera of insects were identified,
   including 16 species of 7 genera Cecidomyiidae. Newly recorded for the
   fauna of Russia are 3 species of 2 genera of mites and 13 species of 8
   genera of gall midges: Aceria labiatiflorae (Thomas), A. thomasi
   (Nalepa), Paraphytoptus chondrillae (Canestrini), Contarinia cardariae

   Fedotova, Jaapiella chondrillae Skuhrava, Spurgia seguierianae Fedotova,
   Euphorbomyia loewii (Mik), Marikovskiana dentipes Marikovskij. Larvae of
   predatory gall midges are almost always found in mite galls.
   Conclusion. Information about the diversity of gall-forming complexes in
   Dagestan will be useful for assessing evolutionary relationships between
   them and plants and will give an idea of the richness of the fauna in
   the organisation of protected natural areas and recreational zones.},

Abstract = {Drawing on unique interviews with former jihadists from Russia's
   autonomous republic of Dagestan, this article is the first to examine
   the impact of ethnicity on jihadist groups' methods of organization and
   operations, primarily in terms of their target selection, local support,
   and recruitment and leadership policies. It distinguishes between
   largely monoethnic rural jamaatsor jihadist groupsand multiethnic urban
   jamaats, pointing to the contested nature of ethnicity, particularly in
   the latter group. It examines the steps taken by the leadership of urban
   jamaats to overcome ethnic cleavages and avoid interethnic tension both
   within the jihadists' ranks and with regard to the local population. The
   article illustrates that, as a divisive phenomenon in multiethnic urban
   jamaats, ethnic identity has been deliberately downplayed by the
   leadership of these groups at the expense of strengthening supra-ethnic
   Salafi-jihadist identity. The article also highlights the significance
   of ethnic identity in jihadist groups, in spite of it being
   contradictory to Salafi-jihadist doctrine.},

Abstract = {Aim. Determination of the importance of the ecological vector in
   ensuring the sustainable development of the Republic of Dagestan.
   Materials and Methods. A historical and comparative analysis was carried
   out using official statistical data of Rosstat and data from state
   reports on the state and on environmental protection.
   Results. The author proposes that there be a focus on the formation of
   public and individual ecological consciousness of citizens, the
   involvement of the population in various environmental actions, the use
   of alternative energy sources and the development of tourism in the
   republic, taking into account the proper level of protection of natural
   objects.
   Conclusion. The Republic of Dagestan, due to its geographical and
   climatic features, has more potential in the field of sustainable
   development than any other region of our country, but it seems that the
   best results require the application of all the actions listed herein
   aimed at strengthening the role of the environmental component of
   sustainable development.},

Abstract = {Mites in seaweeds from two distant sites of the Dagestan State Nature
   Reserve, namely from the Kizlyar Bay and Samoor Forest, were studied.
   Total of 31 species of mesostigmatic mites (Acari: Mesostigmata) and 31
   species of oribatid mites (Acari: Oribatida) were collected and
   identified. The other mites (Astigmata, Prostigmata, and Endeostigmata)
   belong to 19 families. One species of gamasid mites {[}Gamasellodes
   vulgatior (Athias-Henriot, 1961)] and two species of oribatids
   {[}Austrophthiracarus cf. duplex (Mahunka \& Mahunka-Papp, 2010);
   Xenillus moyae Perez-Inigo \& Pena, 1994] are recorded from Russia for
   the first time. Among 62 identified species, 28 (including the majority
   of Mesostigmata) were not previously recorded in Dagestan. The faunistic
   similarity of species lists from two sites was only 13.1\% (Jaccard's
   coefficient). The input of broadly hydrophilic mite species (15\% of the
   total list) is noticeable. However, no characteristic halophilic
   (littoral) species were found. Most likely, this is due to the absence
   of marine macrophytes (and their emissions) in studied soft-ground
   coastal areas. It is during their decay that a specialized saprophilic
   complex of invertebrates is commonly formed.},

Abstract = {The article examines the appellative vocabulary of the Avar and Dargin
   languages related to agriculture. Attention is paid to the analysis of
   folk geographical terms, especially agroonymic terms that form the
   to-ponymy of two ethnoregions of Dagestan. The analysis of the presented
   materials of the Avar and Dargin lan-guages shows that the vocabulary
   associated with agri- culture is well preserved in microtoponymy. The
   novelty of the study is seen in the fact that a large number of words
   related to ancient farming systems indicates the long preservation of
   archaic methods of land cultivation in the territory of the Avars and
   Dargins, which in turn led to the preservation of many farming terms and
   their consolidation in microtoponymy. The relevance of the study is due
   to the fact that the field material collected by the authors in the
   mountainous areas of Accident and Darga is introduced into scientific
   circulation, and a classification of nine semantic subgroups
   ofagroonymic terms is proposed. It is also important to analyze the
   material in the aspect of comparing farming terms in different dialects.
   The article describes the experience of the authors' long-term work in
   the study ofAvar and Dargin microtoponyms.},

Abstract = {The Dagestan Mountain (DM) cattle breed was established to provide
   cheese and milk products to mountain dwellers in the specific conditions
   of the Republic of Dagestan in Southern Russia. Only 650 head of DM
   cattle were registered in 2020, and their ``breed purity{''} is
   questionable. We aimed to assess the genetic diversity and population
   structure of modern DM cattle using short tandem repeat (STR) markers.
   The sample included 150 animals collected from private owners in
   Dagestan during a scientific expedition (n = 32) and provided by a gene
   pool farm (n = 118). An additional 166 samples from other cattle breeds
   distributed in the breeding zone of DM cattle were used as the
   comparison groups. The genotypes for the 11 STR loci recommended by ISAG
   were obtained using a genetic analyzer. We identified a high level of
   genetic diversity as revealed by allelic richness calculations (Ar =
   6.82 vs. 4.38-5.82 in other cattle breeds) and observed heterozygosity
   indices (uHe = 0.76 vs. 0.65-0.72). Based on the STRUCTURE results,
   animals with low levels of admixture with other breeds were found within
   the DM cattle, which can be considered as candidates for use in
   germplasm conservation programs.},

Abstract = {The study of religious and political attitudes of young people at the
   all-Russian and regional levels is always of great interest for the
   research community. The paper is based on the results of a mass
   political and sociological survey of 1 220 young people (aged from 18 to
   25 years old) of the Republic of Dagestan in 2017. The sociological
   survey was conducted throughout Dagestan, among young men and women
   living in cities and rural areas. The study touches upon the assessment
   of religious revival, the characteristics of the religious situation in
   Dagestan, the aggravation of the religious situation in the republic,
   the youth's preferences for social and State organization, the
   orientation of contacts with Islamic states, the attitudes of youth to
   ISIS and the likelihood of their participation in the ranks of ISIS and
   other religion-based terrorist organizations, the attitude of youth
   towards the military actions of Russia against ISIS in Syria, the
   sources of religious information, reflecting the religious component on
   interethnic relations.
   The study shows that the level of religiosity among Dagestan youth is at
   a high level, which is especially evident in some issues, and this
   causes some concern. However, this phenomenon is not critical. Young
   people remain oriented towards secularism in the State system. For young
   people, the economic and political factor is more important than the
   religious one, which has more spiritual and moral significance. The
   youth is aware of and supports the foreign policy course of the
   country's leadership and approves the military-political policy in
   Syria.},

   <SUP>13</SUP><SUP>7</SUP>Cs, <SUP>210</SUP>Pb on environmental objects
   and their relationship with bovine leukemia in ecosystems of the
   Republic of Dagestan},

Abstract = {Aim. To conduct studies on the content of radionuclides Sr-90, Cs-13(7),
   Pb-210 and determine the total beta-activity in objects (samples) of the
   external environment, as well as to investigate the effect of
   radioactive isotopes on the spread of bovine leukemia in the Republic of
   Dagestan.
   Materials and Methods. Samples (haylage, natural grass, silage, compound
   feed, milk, etc.) that were obtained from various locations of the
   Republic of Dagestan were used for radiological research. The method of
   research was radiochemical analysis using the universal spectrometric
   complex ``Gamma Plus{''}, etc. For bovine leukemia the principal
   material was the reporting data of the Republican Veterinary Laboratory,
   supplemented by our own research from 1988 to 2008. The research was
   carried out by generally recognized methods in serology and hematology.
   Results. After the studies were conducted, a high content of
   radionuclides Sr-90 and Cs-137 was found in environmental objects from
   1986-198, and the activity of nuclide Pb-210 in the ecosystem of the
   republic increased tenfold compared to 1985. An important indicator such
   as the total beta-activity in the republic also increased in the period
   (from 1986-1988) after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power
   station. In 1988, we recorded the maximum number (32.2\%) of infected
   animals with the bovine leukemia virus and in subsequent years the
   percentage of hemo-diseased heads of cattle in the farms of the republic
   increased.
   Conclusion. Thus, there is a causal relationship between the activity of
   radionuclides and the decrease in the immune status of animals, which
   may lead to the increase in the spread of bovine leukemia in the
   republic.},

Abstract = {Aim. The environmental-epidemiological monitoring of socially
   significant pathology and its forecasting for the development of
   effective preventive measures and environmental quality management
   methods in the Republic of Dagestan
   Material and Methods. An epidemiological analysis of public health
   indicators was carried out in 41 municipalities and 10 urban districts
   of the Republic of Dagestan. This was carried out through current and
   retrospective analysis of regional health indicators,
   medical-geographical and mathematical statistical analysis. The data
   sources for the main indicators reflect the epidemiological situation in
   the Republic of Dagestan from 1997 to 2016.
   Results. An understanding of the status of the main epidemiological
   indicators of the condition of public health of the region's rural and
   urban population was obtained and future dynamics predicted. An
   integrated assessment of the well-being of the territory of the republic
   revealed areas and cities with adverse trends in public health in the
   main groups of socially significant and environmentally-related
   pathologies.
   Conclusions. An integrated assessment of the state of well-being in the
   Republic of Dagestan by groups of epidemiological indicators of general
   morbidity, general morbidity of various age groups of the population,
   socially significant and environmentally-caused morbidity, as well as a
   forecast of their dynamics, revealed adverse trends in public health in
   rural populations of Tsuntinskiy, Akhtynskiy, Gunibskiy, Kulinskiy,
   Tabasaranskiy, Nogayskiy, Novolakskiy, Suleiman-Stalskiy,
   Khasavyurtskiy, Tarumovskiy districts and of the cities of Kaspiysk,
   Dagestanskie Ogni, Makhachkala and Kizilyurt. An analysis of the sources
   of supplies of drinking water revealed a positive correlation between
   heavy metals content and adverse trends in socially significant
   pathology in the regions of Northern Dagestan.},

Abstract = {Aim. To study the polymorphism of the genes calpastatin (CAST),
   somatotropin (GH) and differential growth factor (GDF9) of sheep of the
   Dagestan mountain breed.
   Material and Methods. Studies on the genetic typing of Dagestan mountain
   sheep according to CAST, GH and GDF9 genes were carried out in
   conditions of distant pasture farming in the Republic of Dagestan by the
   Genetics and Breeding Laboratory of the Federal Agrarian Scientific
   Centre of the Republic of Dagestan, an accredited laboratory of
   immunogenetics and DNA technologies of the All-Russian Research
   Institute of Sheep and Goat Breeding and a branch of the North Caucasus
   Federal Scientific Agrarian Centre. These investigations were undertaken
   by the PCR-RFLP method (polymyrase chain reaction - restriction fragment
   length polymorphism) on a Tersik four-channel programmable thermal
   cycler from DNA-Technologia (Russia) using specific primers synthesized
   in the SYNTHOL research and production laboratory (Moscow).
   Results. Carrying out PCR-RFLP revealed breed-specific alleles with
   different frequency of occurrence, which was: in the locus of the CAST
   gene - allele CAST(N) - 0.03; allele CAST(M) - 0.97; at the GH gene
   locus - GH(A) allele - 100.0, GH(B) allele - 0; in the locus of the GDF9
   gene - the GDF9(A) allele - 0.25, the GDF9(G) allele - 0.75, which
   determined the frequency of occurrence of the homo- and heterozygous
   genotypes: CAST(NN), CAST(MM) and CAST(NM) - 93.0; 0 and 7.0\%; GH(AA),
   GH(BB) and GH(AB) - 100.0 and 0\%; GDF9(AA), GDF9(GG) and GOF9(AG) -
   16.0, 66.0 and 19.0A, respectively.
   Conclusion. The regularity revealed can be considered as an ecological
   factor that optimizes the adaptive functions of the sheep's organism, on
   the one hand, an evolutionary selection process that contributes to the
   creation of a specific way of genetic structures in the population, on
   the other. The assumption is made that the information obtained can
   serve as the beginning of a more in-depth study of the unique gene pool
   of sheep of the Dagestan rock breed for its further improvement.
   Variants of genetic marker profiles of parental pairs are proposed for
   accumulation in breeding herds bred in different ecological-geographical
   zones and genotypes of carriers of selection-significant genetic
   structures.},

Abstract = {Aim. Assessment of the incidence of leukemia virus in cattle using PCR
   diagnostics in herds of the Republic of Dagestan and study of the
   molecular genetic characteristics of circulating viruses.
   Materials and Methods. 150 cattle blood samples were examined. PCR
   diagnostics of samples for the presence of bovine leukosis virus (BLV)
   were carried out using the RealBest-Vet DNA BLV test system and a
   laboratory set of primers. Some of the samples were sequenced using the
   Sanger method and their phylogenetic analysis was performed.
   Results. Out of 150 samples, 24 samples were positive for the presence
   of BLV. In the Untsukulskiy district, no BLV DNA was detected in any of
   the 16 samples. In the Karabudakhkentskiy district out of 40 - in 2 (5
   \%), in Buynakskiy district - in 1 out of 30 (3.3 \%) and in
   Babayurtovskiy districtin 21 out of 60 samples BLV was detected (35 \%).
   For 13 BLV-positive samples, fragments of the env gene measuring 1000 bp
   were obtained and deciphered. According to phylogenetic analysis, 7
   samples of BLV belong to the 7th, and 6 - to the 4th genotype of BLV.
   The BLV genotype 4 isolated in the Babayurtovskiy district clusters with
   viruses from Kazakhstan, while viruses of genotype 4 from other farms
   cluster with Russian BLV. The studied samples of genotype 4 did not form
   common clusters. For the BLV genotype 7 isolated in farms of the
   Babayurtovskiy district, on the contrary, a combination of sequences
   into one cluster of genetically similar viruses was observed.
   Conclusion. Significant differences in the incidence of leukemia virus
   in livestock on farms in Dagestan were revealed. No patterns were found
   in the registration of cattle cases with a specific breed of cattle or
   with the age of the animal. It has been shown that viruses of both
   genotypes 7 and 4 circulate in the Republic. For BLV 4, it is assumed
   that there are different ways of its introduction into farms but no
   associated chains of virus spread have been found. For BLV genotype 7,
   transmission of BLV has been registered, which indicates the need to
   strengthen leukemia prevention measures on farms.},

Abstract = {Aim. The aim of the research is to consider the medical and social
   aspects of artificially terminating pregnancy in the Republic of
   Dagestan. Material and methods. To achieve this goal, we have created a
   database of the cases of artificial abortion in the Republic of
   Dagestan. Statistical processing of the results of the study was carried
   out using software packages like STATISTICA and Excel. Results. The
   total number of abortions for the study period was 157526 cases, of
   which 26\% of cases were spontaneous abortions, 8.9\% of cases were
   abortions for medical reasons. During the period under review, there was
   an increase in the number of spontaneous abortions and abortions due to
   medical indications by 170\% and 108.6\%, respectively. There is the
   prevalence of abortions of the pregnancy of up to 12 week-period,
   including mini-abortions, the average percentage of the total number of
   abortions for the study period was 90\%. In the Republic of Dagestan,
   the average annual intensive standardized abortion rate was 14.67 cases
   per 1,000 women of childbearing age women of childbearing age (WCA). And
   among the urban population, this number is higher, and amounted to 25.57
   \%o against 6.25 \%o in rural areas. The highest values of the average
   long-term intensive frequency of abortions are observed in the cities of
   Kizilyurt, Derbent, Makhachkala, Kaspiisk; in the countrysides:
   Dakhadayevsky, Tarumovsky, Laksky and Babaurtovsky districts.
   Conclusion. The problem of abortion, despite the steady tendency to
   reduce their number, still needs to be solved because it is the leading
   cause of maternal death in Russia, inflammatory diseases of the
   genitals, infertility, and it also adversely affects the course of
   subsequent pregnancies and births, increasing the frequency miscarriage,
   maternal and perinatal pathology.},

Abstract = {Aim. The aim of the work is to carry out an analysis of the wetlands of
   the Republic of Dagestan in order to justify the selection of the
   collecting sites for material from migratory aquatic and semi aquatic
   birds in order to monitor the influenza A virus. Material and methods.
   Studying scientific publications of different years and available
   information on the wetlands of the Caspian Dagestan allowed establishing
   the areas of concentration of aquatic and semiaquatic birds where
   effective sampling for avian influenza is possible. Results. The spread
   of avian influenza viruses in nature is inextricably linked with
   migration of birds. Due to the presence of a large number of reservoirs,
   the western part of the Caspian region brings together large populations
   of wild waterbirds from various places within their migration routes.
   Mass accumulation encourages the interaction of birds of different
   species and populations, which in turn creates favorable conditions for
   the spread of various viral diseases. Conclusion. For an integrated
   assessment of the state of aquatic and semiaquatic bird populations, as
   well as monitoring the avian influenza infection rates, it is proposed
   to consider as model areas the wetlands of the Lake Aji (Papas), Lake
   Yuzhny Agrakhan, Agrakhansky Gulf, the Terek River delta and the
   Achikolsky systems of lake.},

Abstract = {Aim. The aim of the study is to show the possibility and efficiency of
   large-scale industrial production of microalgae in the Republic of
   Dagestan for the development of agriculture (feed for animals and
   poultry) and other technological applications in the food and
   pharmaceutical industries for the production of algalin flour (eco
   bread), polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3, omega-6) physiologically
   necessary for humans, biologically active substances (astaxanthin,
   phycocyanin), new-generation antibiotics, biofuels and other high added
   value biotechnological products. The problems of using microalgae for
   bioremediation of the environment, in particular, purification of
   geothermal waters from phenols before discharging into the sewage system
   are considered. Methods. Microalgae are grown in closed and open type
   plants. Valuable algae components can be extracted using supercritical
   fluid technology of continuous action. Results. We give a comparative
   evaluation of the efficiency of using microalgae as a biological raw
   material in comparison with traditionally used oilseeds. Conclusion. For
   Dagestan, located on the shore of the Caspian Sea, with its warm climate
   and an abundance of solar and geothermal energy, the development of this
   technology is a task of great economic importance. The advantages of
   microalgae technologies are the basis for the creation of large-scale
   production of microalgae in southern Russia. Biotechnology in Dagestan
   can become not only profitable, but also a high-tech and innovative
   industry.},

Title = {Comparative Analysis of Residents' Self-Assessment of Health in the City
   of Makhachkala and the Untsukulskiy District of the Republic of Dagestan},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {Aim. To conduct a comparative analysis of the self-assessment of health
   by urban and rural residents of the Republic of Dagestan, using as
   examples the city of Makhachkala and the Untsukulskiy district.
   Material and Methods. Sociological research methods were employed on the
   basis of questionnaires.
   Results. According to the results of the study the majority of the
   residents of Makhachkala and the Untsukulskiy district surveyed - 71\%
   and 68.2\% respectively gave positive assessments of their health. In
   both samples, the proportion of respondents who rated their health as
   ``mediocre{''} and ``bad{''} increased with age. In rural areas the
   number of young and middle-aged respondents who assessed their health as
   worse exceeded the number of city dwellers of the same age. Among male
   respondents, 77.8\% in Makhachkala and 74.9\% in the Untsukulskiy
   district gave a positive self-assessment of health and among the female
   population, 66.7\% and 62.93\% respectively.
   Conclusion. Self-assessment of health is a tool recommended by the World
   Health Organization for monitoring health within selected population
   groups. The slight difference between the assessment of their health by
   urban and rural residents is due to differences in lifestyle and
   standard of living, access to medical as well as cultural, leisure and
   other types of services.},

Abstract = {The authors analyze the incidence of precancer dermatoses and skin
   cancer in three population groups (total n = 7500) living in various
   geographic zones of Daghestan: urban population and rural population of
   the plains and highlands, occupationally exposed to factors conducive to
   cancer development. i. e. hyperthermia, chemical irritants, high
   insolation, other environmental factors. A high incidence of skin
   precancer and cancer (0.3 and 1.3\%, respectively) was detected among
   the highlanders exposed to high insolation. Basal-cell carcinoma in
   these areas is 3-4 times more incident that squamous-cell carcinoma.
   Precancer dermatoses and skin cancer involve open skin sites in 45-80\%
   of cases. Untimely visits to doctors result in development of grave
   forms of skin cancer. Early active detection of skin precancer and
   cancer is the key point in timely diagnosis, treatment, and prevention
   of this condition, particularly of its grave forms.},

Abstract = {An analysis of the avifauna of the arid Botlikh depression in the
   mountains of Dagestan, where 112 breeding bird species have been
   recorded, shows noticeable transformations in its composition noted
   during the 19th to 21st centuries. Within the arid depression, an
   increase in the number and expansion of nemoral, forest- steppe and sub-
   Mediterranean dendrophiles is observed, as well as the appearance of
   Siberian mountain- taiga species at nesting sites. At the same time,
   there is a decrease in the number and the disappearance of xerophilic
   sclerophylls, which are part of the desert- mountain faunal complex of
   the Nomadian type of fauna. This may be due to both climate change,
   which affects birds indirectly through vegetation and a reduction in the
   specific food supply, and the consequences of anthropogenic impacts on
   the natural environment (forest restoration, degradation of agriculture
   and livestock breeding), possibly also through competitive relationships
   between some animal species. Similar changes are noted not only in the
   avifauna of Dagestan, but also in the Western Caucasus, as well as in
   the steppe zone in southern Russia, this indicating large- scale
   zoogeographic processes occurring there. The identified transformations
   of regional faunas require further, intensified faunal monitoring, which
   will make it possible to clarify the speed of ongoing processes and
   provide zoogeographic forecasts for the near future.},

Abstract = {Studying of economic transformations in RSFSR regions, including
   Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (hereinafter referred to
   as DASSR),during their integration with neighboring state formations in
   the most difficult period of modernization of the state system is one of
   the most important areas in establishment of the modern strategy of
   Russian economic development. The studied issue is important because no
   analysis of facts evidencing the process of DASSR integration into the
   common Russian economic space has been performed yet in spite of its
   necessity. The main purpose of this article is a brief analysis of the
   history of establishment of economic relations of the Republic of
   Dagestan with RSFSR regions in 1985-1991. The said issue was studied
   with regard to a cause-to-effect and in-sequence considering the
   principles of objectivity and a historical method by means of methods of
   logical data synthesis, retrospective review, and comparative analysis
   of events of historic reality. Besides, statistical, analytic, and
   induction research methods were applied to reflect the changing indexes
   of the depth of Dagestani integration into the Russian space more
   accurately and visually. The process of development of economic contacts
   founded in the North-Caucasian Economic Region in the environment of the
   state system modernization is tracked in the article based on new
   archive materials, periodicals and Internet data. Causes and reasons of
   their establishment were described, the enterprises participating in the
   economic exchange were indicated, and the list of exchanged products was
   represented. The rate of the process of republican interaction the with
   Russian enterprises was analyzed, and the extent of their co-dependence
   was determined. The article may be useful for both historian and
   economist researches and officers of ministries and authorities to
   design a future strategy of economic development of the Republic of
   Dagestan and Russia in general.},

Abstract = {The article examines the mechanisms of functioning of internet
   communication and social networks in the translocal rural communities of
   Dagestan, a Russian Federation region in the North Caucasus, whose
   members have been participating in the labor migration to industrial
   Russian cities. Huge distances and various sociocultural and economic
   differences between the sending and the receiving societies pose a
   challenge to the unity of the rural community, djamaat. Rural identity
   is salient for migrants: they preserve the principle of rural endogamy,
   bury all the dead migrants in their village, spend money and time on the
   development of the village, and create public organizations of fellow
   villagers. The article focuses on the practice of using mobile social
   networks- Facebook and its Russian counterparts-by transmigrants, their
   families, and fellow villagers. Social media provide everyday family
   communication and serve as a platform for performing important social
   rites such as finding a bride, matchmaking, remitting money for
   condolences, as well as transferring important information between
   migrants and those living in the village. Rural chats consolidate the
   community and formulate the idea of the unity and also become power and
   economic resources for migrants. At the same time, the villagers' chats
   are the places where the laws of reputation are at work, therefore they
   can also demonstrate positive or negative social capital and carry a
   danger for migrants, especially for women.},

Title = {THE BOUNDARIES OF THE DJAMAAT: THE PARTICULAR FEATURES OF DANGESTAN'S
   TRANSLOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THE CONTEXT OF MIGRATION FLOWS WITHIN THE

Abstract = {This paper analyses the contemporary structure and functioning of
   Dagestan's rural communities in a context of internal Russian migration,
   particularly to the cities of Western Siberia. The concepts of
   transnationalism and translocality are deployed as a theoretical
   framework to analyse the migrant and his social world without detaching
   ourselves from the donor community, the djamaat. It is argued that the
   Dagestan rural community, in the course of the migration processes of
   recent decades, can no longer be viewed merely as a local social entity.
   A new translocal community has emerged, organized on the principle of
   the `Global Village', that consists of migrants, their family members
   and non-migrants remaining in the home villages. Translocal migrants,
   existing simultaneously in several geographically separated points,
   continue to construct their identity and their social networks, a
   process that fosters a sense of belonging to a Dagestani village. The
   donor rural community is an important space where migrants can
   demonstrate personal successes and new entrepreneurial and philanthropic
   economic activities. Migrants invest not only in their own households
   but also help their native villages as a whole through entrepreneurial
   activity and financial support. In addition, the key moments of life
   remain rooted in the village. Migrants prefer to find a marriage partner
   from their home village. The home village is also seen to be the only
   acceptable burial place for deceased migrants. A major role in the
   consolidation of a translocal djamaat is played by Internet resources
   such as social networks and messenger programmes, which construct social
   networks and maintain communication among fellow countrymen in real
   time. This preference for preserving ties to one's rural locality even
   after resettlement out of the village and the Republic of Dagestan, as
   well as the maintenance of translocal links, allow us to speak of a new
   social entity: the translocal community.},

Abstract = {The use of woody biomass obtained from pruning and removal of perennial
   agricultural plantations for energy needs is a relatively new direction,
   which is now actively explored and developed in Europe. In Russia,
   horticulture and viticulture is also a traditional direction of
   agriculture in the southern regions, in particular, in the Republic of
   Dagestan. Dagestan is a volatile region with a variety of problems in
   the fuel and energy complex. The solution to these problems may become
   the use of renewable energy resources in the region. The paper presents
   the methodology for assessment of bioenergy resources in the region with
   the use of spatial analysis. The main purpose is to determine the
   optimal economically and technologically available energy technology for
   the estimated energy resource. The results show the high importance of
   social and economic factors for the development of renewable energy in
   the region, which is not typical for the other regions of Russia and
   should be taken into account in the further development of the
   methodology of multi-stage bioenergy resource assessment.},

Abstract = {Aim. Assessment of the extent of the distribution and danger of
   activation of landslide processes in the Republic of Dagestan.
   Material and Methods. The principal materials used were data of the
   government monitoring of subsoil conducted by Hydrospetzgeologiya and
   its southern regional and territorial centres (Dagestangeomonitoring)
   over the past fifteen years and published in the open press, as well as
   other literature sources. Maps were compiled using ArcGIS software.
   Results. An assessment was made of the extent of the distribution and
   danger of occurrence of landslide processes (for the period 2004-2018)
   in urban and rural settlements, on linear infrastructure (highways, oil,
   gas and water pipelines, power lines) and in reservoirs of large
   hydroelectric power stations of the republic. There was a high level of
   landslide activity recorded in 2004, 2005 and 2014, the lowest in 2007
   and 2012. The largest number of landslide occurrences was recorded in
   the areas of Makhachkala city (12.7\%) and Tlyarotinskiy (9.6\%),
   Dokuzparinskiy (8.1\%), Buynakskiy (6.1\%), Tsuntinskiy (5.4\%) and
   Tsumadinskiy (5.0\%) districts. Landslides were most often activated in
   the summer period (41.6\%). 31.5\% of landslides occurred in spring,
   22.6\% in autumn and 4.3\% in winter.
   Conclusion. Analysis of landslide activity in the territory of Dagestan
   showed that the presence of favorable physico-geographical conditions
   for the development of landslide processes and active economic activity
   contribute to the wide distribution of landslides in the mountainous
   part of the republic.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Tat language is classified in an Iranian subbranch of the
   Indo-European family. It is spoken in the Caucasus and in the West
   Caspian region by populations with heterogeneous cultural traditions and
   religion whose ancestry is unknown. The aim of this study is to get a
   first insight about the genetic history of this peculiar linguistic
   group. Methods: We investigated the uniparental gene pools, defined by
   NRY and mtDNA high-resolution markers, in two Tati-speaking communities
   from Dagestan: Mountain Jews or Juhur, who speak the Judeo-Tat dialect,
   and the Tats, who speak the Muslim-Tat dialect. The samples have been
   collected in monoethnic rural villages and selected on the basis of
   genealogical relationships. A novel approach aimed at resolving cryptic
   cases in the recent history of human populations, which combines the
   properties of uniparental genetic markers with the potential of
   forward-in-time computer simulations, is presented. Results: Judeo-Tats
   emerged as a group with tight matrilineal genetic legacy who separated
   early from other Jewish communities. Tats exhibited genetic signals of a
   much longer in situ evolution, which appear as substantially unlinked
   with other Indo-Iranian enclaves in the Caucasus. Conclusions: The
   independent demographic histories of the two samples, with mutually
   reversed profiles at paternally and maternally transmitted genetic
   systems, suggest that geographic proximity and linguistic assimilation
   of Tati-speakers from Dagestan do not reflect a common ancestry. (C)

Title = {Number and trends of the development of the population of Dagestan in
   the 90s of the 20th century - 2010},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the historical and demographic analysis of the
   number and development trends of the population of the multinational
   region of the country in the 1990s - 2010s. It is shown that the
   demographic processes in the republic were negatively affected by the
   collapse in the standard of living of the bulk of the republic's
   population during the liberal market reforms in the new conditions.
   Dagestan remained one of the few regions of the country in which there
   was an increase in the number of both urban and rural populations. At
   the same time, there was a stable tendency to the predominance of the
   rural population in its total number, which was due to the predominance
   of the agrarian sector in the economy of the mountainous region, as well
   as inclination of the bulk of the population to the traditional rural
   way of life. The patterns and regional features of the formation and
   further development of urban and rural population in the republic are
   traced. It was noted that in the region there were 10 cities of
   republican subordination, the largest of which was the administrative,
   industrial and cultural center of the Republic of Dagestan- Makhachkala.
   The overall growth of the urban population in the multinational region
   as a whole and in the context of individual cities (except for the city
   of Yuzhno-Suhokumsk) continued. The author, using the materials of the
   population censuses of 1989, 2002, 2010, and other reliable statistical
   data, analyzed the sources of positive changes in the population, the
   predominant of which was the natural increase. The age and sex
   composition of the urban and rural population of the republic is
   characterized, among which the children and people of working age
   prevailed, which created favorable opportunities for the development of
   the branches of material production and the socio-cultural sphere.
   However, in the conditions of economic difficulties in the analyzed
   decades, they remained not fully realized, which caused an increase in
   the outflow of people of working age to other regions of the country in
   search of work. The same was associated with the need to increase
   attention to the development of sociocultural infrastructure in the
   region, primarily in the Dagestani village. The document focuses on the
   analysis of the national composition of the region's population, showing
   the growth of the total number of all Dagestani peoples during the
   decade under review, although the growth rates of some of them have
   varied.The changes in the zonal settlement of the population, the
   increase in its inflow into the flat areas of the republic were traced,
   which was accompanied by an increase in the overpopulation of the
   population by the aggravation of the problem of employing young people
   in the branches of the economy.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the research was to study 8 Georgian and 3 Dagestan
   technical autochthonous grapevine varieties and identify the most
   productive and promising ones for high-quality winemaking in the Rostov
   region. The research was conducted in 2016-2019 at Don ampelographic
   collection named after Ya.I. Potapenko (Novocherkassk, Russia) according
   to generally accepted methods and state Standards in viticulture. Don
   autochthonous varieties Sibirkovyij and Krasnostop zolotovskij were used
   as controls. The soil - ordinary Chernozem carbonate. All the studied
   varieties had a high percentage of bud break (from 69.3\% in Hotsa
   tsibil to 81.2\% in Mahbor tsibil). The fruiting coefficient of 1.0 or
   more was observed in 6 varieties. The average weight of a bunch varied
   from 74 g (Mudzhuretuli) to 459 g (Adreuli shavi). The estimated yield
   was very high for the varieties - Adreuli shavi and Nakutvneuli, high -
   Goruli mtsvane, Hotsa tsibil, medium - Latsu kere, Grdzelmtevana,
   Grubela, Amlakhu, Sibirkovyij, Vernakhi and Krasnostop zolotovskij.
   Grapevine varieties Goruli mtsvane, Grdzelmtevana, Grubela, Latsu kere,
   Hotsa tsibil, Nakutvneuli were selected as prospective due to agronomic
   traits and high quality of wine. These varieties are also recommended to
   be used in breeding for creating varieties with high technological
   properties for highquality winemaking.},

Abstract = {Aim. The aim of the research was to identify the effect of types of
   fertilizer on increasing soil fertility and corn yield of grain and
   sorghum in conditions of irrigation of the Tersko-Sulak subprovince.
   Methods. Carrying out some field experiments: conducting observations
   and laboratory tests, selection of soil and plant samples was carried
   out according to generally accepted methods: statistical processing of
   yield data was carried out by the method of variance analysis based on
   Kirov Federal State Unitary Enterprise and FSBSI Dagestan Agricultural
   Research Institute named after F.G. Kisriev. Results. Studies showed
   that in the post-harvest period after harvesting winter wheat, it is
   better to cultivate green manure with the presence of legumes. A
   valuable biological feature of them is the ability to absorb atmospheric
   nitrogen. The powerful root system of the seeding pea improves the
   physical properties of the soil, as well as microbiological activity.
   The most favorable conditions are created for the growth and development
   of maize and sorghum, after plowing of fertilizers in the stubble period
   in the conditions of irrigation of the Tersko-Sulak subprovince, by
   applying mineral fertilizers at a dose of N-150 P-75 K-75, seeding peas,
   manure (30 t / ha), In these cases, on average, over two years, the
   highest yield of maize was 5.6-5.7-5.5 t / ha and grain sorghum,
   respectively, 4.7-4.8-4.5 t / ha. Conclusion. For the first time, in
   conditions of irrigation of the Tersko-Sulak subprovince, were obtained
   the results on the effectiveness of different types of fertilizers
   introduced into the soil.},

Title = {Ecological and epidemiological features of the distribution of
   toxoplasmosis in the territory of Dagestan},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {152-158},
Abstract = {Aim. To study the ecological and epidemiological features of the spread
   of toxoplasmosis in the territory of the Republic of Dagestan.
   Material and Methods. A total of 3152 people in the 7-50 years age range
   living in Makhachkala, Kaspiysk, Derbent and rural settlements of
   different climatic and geographical zones of the republic, were examined
   for toxoplasmosis. Among those surveyed were 1817 women and 82 children.
   Disease with toxoplasmosis was diagnosed according to laboratory and
   clinical and epidemiological data. Of the serological research methods,
   RIF (immunofluorescence reaction) and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay) were used. Based on the survey results, ecological and
   epidemiological maps were complied
   Results. It was revealed that the inhabitants of lowlands are 1,7 times
   more likely to be infected with toxoplasmosis than mountain settlements.
   The unequal frequency of toxoplasmosis infection in residents of
   mountainous and foothill areas depends not only on the altitude of the
   area above sea level, but also on soil moisture (plains and foothills),
   the intensity of isolation (highlands), as well as contact with infected
   domestic and agricultural animals. Infection with toxoplasma invasion in
   different territories varied within the range of 17.3\%-29.1\%.
   Conclusion. Identification of the sources of toxopiasma invasion was
   undertaken structured around regionally-oriented methods for the
   prevention of the disease. Typifying the sources of toxoplasmosis
   included monitoring: levels of sanitation when in contact with
   insufficiently thermally processed food products; obligatory hand
   washing after working with the soil; contact with pets; special sanitary
   and veterinary control over persons in contact with animals, as well as
   sanitary and medical care of patients and pregnant women.},

Title = {Specific Features of the Pool of Hydrolytic Enzymes in Soils of
   Agricultural Terraces in the Eastern Caucasus},
Journal = {EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {A study of the influence of farming practices in the Middle Ages (X-XV
   AD) on the activities of 11 hydrolytic enzymes involved in the
   biogeochemical cycles of major elements in soils has been carried out.
   Agrostratozems of Medieval agricultural terraces in Dagestan mountains
   (Plaggic and Hortic Anthrosols) were chosen as objects of study. In all
   cases, the enzymatic activity of the studied soils decreased in all soil
   layers in the following sequence: alkaline phosphatase >
   phosphodiesterase > acid phosphatase > pyrophosphatase >= leucine
   aminopeptidase > arylsulfatase > chitinase > beta-glucosidase > xylanase
   > alpha-glucosidase > cellobiohydrolase. The enzymatic activity of the
   studied soils was primarily determined by the amount of microbial
   biomass (C-mic). Thus, the activity of enzymes of various groups
   depended on C-mic by 61-94\%. Agricultural practices associated with
   ploughing, manuring, and irrigation induce the convergence in the
   activity of nitrogen cycle enzymes in soils of the mountain zone, which
   is associated with similar features of the nitrogen cycle in agrogenic
   soils, regardless of bioclimatic conditions. The addition of organic
   materials has led to an increase in the physiological efficiency of
   microbial communities and the rate of enzyme production, and high levels
   of biological activity can persist in soil for about 1000 years.
   Ploughing with the application of organic fertilizers in the past led to
   an increase in enzymatic activity expressed per unit of microbial
   biomass (specific activity), therefore, this indicator can be used as an
   indicator of agrogenic transformation of soils in the past.},

   activity, and satisfaction with the quality of medical care in public
   health institutions by residents of rural settlements of the Untsukul
   district, Republic of Dagestan. Methods. The study was conducted by the
   method of questioning 2643 respondents, among them 1453 women and 1181
   men. Results. According to the results of the survey, the majority of
   the interviewed residents of Untsukul district (68.2\%) are satisfied
   with their health. Medical activity of the population at the time of the
   study was 60.6\%. As to respondents who applied to the medical
   institutions of the Untsukul district during this period, 13.5\% are not
   satisfied with the quality of medical care in public health
   institutions, 23.5\% are fully satisfied, 30\% are not fully satisfied.
   Conclusion. A social survey in the form of a questionnaire is one of the
   most effective methods of obtaining information about the self-rated
   health of the population. Timely analysis of medical activity of the
   population, its satisfaction with the quality of medical care will
   improve the efficiency of the health system.},

Title = {The effect of nitrogen fertilisation on the yield and quality of winter
   wheat grain on meadow-chestnut soil},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {Aim. The study of the effect of nitrogen fertilization on the yield and
   quality of winter wheat grain on meadow-chestnut soil.Methods. Analyses
   of soil samples were carried out using generally accepted standard
   techniques. Assessment of the biological yield of grain and its
   structure was carried out according to the ``Methodology of the State
   Variety Testing of Agricultural Crops{''}. Tillage for winter crops
   after stubble predecessors was carried out according to the irrigation
   half steam system.Results. With an increase in the hydrothermal
   coefficient, a more elastic gluten is formed. Studies have shown that as
   the dose of nitrogen fertilizing increases, the indicators of the sowing
   qualities of seeds and the baking qualities of winter wheat grain of the
   Grom variety improve. In the best variant N90P90, the following
   indicators were obtained: seed germination energy - 99\%, germination -
   100\%, weight of 1000 grains - 34.7 g, protein content - 14.8\%, gluten
   27.4\%, which represent respectively 4\%; 4\%; 3.9 g; 1.3\% and 6.1\%
   more than in the control variant without the use of mineral fertilizers
   and higher than in the variants N30P90 and N60P90. Conclusion. The
   research area determines the use of the high-intensity Thunder variety,
   which helps to stabilise productivity and improve product quality. The
   use of nitrogen top dressing (N30, N60 and N90) against the background
   of P90 increases the yield of winter wheat grain from 6.25 to 7.90 t /
   ha and improves the main indicators of baking qualities of grain:
   protein - 14.3-14.8\% and gluten - 22.1-27.4\%, the best option with
   nitrogen top dressing being a dose of N90 (N30 in autumn + N60 in
   spring).},

Abstract = {Polymorphism of gliadins was investigated in Aegilops tauschii from
   primary habitats ``4{''}, near Hily, and ``6{''}, near Rukel, in
   Dagestan, Russia 205 individual plants were analysed (53/50 and 54/48
   plants of subsp. tauschii/subsp. strangulata from the habitats ``4{''}
   and ``6{''}, respectively) and 1/7 and 18/14 different haplotypes were
   found among the plants of subsp. tauschii/subsp. strangulata from the
   habitats ``4{''} and ``6{''}, respectively. No direct evidences of
   cross-pollination were pointed out, although gliadins electrophoretic
   phenotypes obtained allowed to suggest that it occur in Ae. tauschii
   with very low frequency. The data obtained revealed that during Ae.
   tauschii evolutionary history a local habitat could be populated many
   times by different phylogenetic lineages of the species. It was found
   that in Dagestan, at the very edge of the species area, several
   different lineages belonging to different subspecies could for a long
   time co-exist together in a local habit, and in such case a very high
   level of genetic variation in Ae. tauschii could be accumulated on a
   square of less than one hectare. The further studies of genetic
   variation in Ae. tauschii local populations, based on molecular genetic
   methods seems to be very prospective for understanding of peculiarities
   of the species evolution.},

Abstract = {For the first time, the analysis of polymorphism of complete
   mitochondrial genomes was performed in three Dagestan local goat
   populations (n = 37), which were characterized by high genetic and
   haplotype diversity. We found that 90.88\% of the total genetic
   variability was due to intragroup differences and 4.86\% was due to
   intergroup differences. For the studied sample of goats, significant
   negative values of the Tajima's D and Fu's Fs neutrality indices were
   calculated (P < 0.05). We performed a phylogenetic analysis using the
   nucleotide sequences of domestic goats and bezoars belonging to
   different haplogroups. Our study revealed that all studied samples of
   Dagestan Local goats belonged to haplogroup A, which is the most
   frequent one in domestic goats.},

Abstract = {Feeding and spatial distribution of Caucasian chamois and domestic sheep
   were studied in the eastern Caucasus. Trophic analysis showed that the
   chamois diet consisted of 12 herbaceous species and 21 for sheep.
   Chamois selected forbs and fabaceous species, whereas sheep foraged less
   selectively. The trophic niche breadth (averaged) of sheep was
   significantly greater (9.75) than that of chamois (4.33). Trophic niche
   overlap reached 86\% in spring and 56.6\% in autumn, and the summer
   spatial niche breadth of chamois was lower (0.83) than that of sheep
   (1.46). The spatial niche overlapping of both species was low (17\%).
   Five environmental parameters made the highest contributions to
   interspecific differences. Chamois habitats in spring were characterised
   by a lower total phytomass level and higher-calorie herbaceous group
   biomass (forbs, fabaceous) than in sheep-grazing areas, whereas in
   autumn, the high-calorie herbaceous-group biomass was higher in chamois
   habitats than in sheep pastures. We deduce that the chamois spatial
   pattern is a potential response to sheep presence; chamois moves to
   difficult-to-reach habitats. Therefore, ecological segregation could be
   potentially expected due to divergence along the spatial axis of the
   ecological niche.},

Abstract = {The study of agricultural terraces in mountainous Dagestan that date to
   the Middle Ages revealed the polygenetic character of anthropogenic
   soils, which reflects the main stages of their evolution. In light of
   their long-term burial, the soil layers of the preanthropogenic stage of
   evolution were characterized by fairly high values of biological
   activity, with the exception of the biomass of fungal mycelium, a small
   amount of which remained. At the early agrogenic stage, soil plowing
   without irrigation did not significantly change their microbiological
   properties; however, the increase in urease activity in some studied
   profiles may indicate that cattle fertilizers were applied in some areas
   of the terraces. During the Little Ice Age (the 16-18th centuries A.D.)
   the terraces were abandoned, which led to the accumulation of organic
   carbon in the soils as a result of the fallow process, as well as an
   increase in their enzymatic activity. The second agrogenic stage with
   irrigation was characterized by a noticeable growth in the active
   microbial biomass, the soil phosphatase activity, and, in particular,
   the urease activity, which may indicate that farming was intensive and
   organic fertilizers were applied. In the last 20 years, the development
   of terraces under natural conditions led to a noticeable growth in the
   biological activity of upper fallow horizons. However, the urease
   activity significantly decreased in nonirrigated areas, whereas the
   indicators of microbial biomass remained at the same level.},

Abstract = {Aim. The prevalence of some factors affecting the health status of
   residents of 14 rural settlements in the Untsukul District of the
   Republic of Dagestan is established. The total number of respondents was
   2,634, including 1,453 women and 1,181 men. The survey involved people
   aged 18 to 97 years. Methods. The study was carried out by a survey of
   respondents using a questionnaire, including questions on the assessment
   of their self-preserving behavior. Results. The prevalence of risk
   factors for health associated with lifestyle - smoking, regularity and
   quality of food, physical activity. To preserve their own health, the
   majority of respondents (55\%) consider a healthy lifestyle to be
   determined, but the practice of self-preserving behavior is not widely
   spread. Regular meals (at least three times a day) were noted by 51.3\%
   of respondents. The share of respondents, regularly (every day) engaged
   in physical culture and sports, was 27\%. The territorial
   differentiation of inhabited localities of Untsukul region is revealed
   by the prevalence of factors of self-preserving behavior. Conclusion.
   The obtained information on the way of life of residents of the Untsukul
   district can be used in the development of medical and social programs
   aimed at improving the quality of life of the population, creating a
   culture of self-preserving behavior.},

Abstract = {Hoplitis astragali sp. nov., a member of the H. monstrabilis species
   group, and H. dagestanica sp. nov., a member of the H. adunca species
   group, are described. The former species is known from Dagestan in
   Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan, the latter only from Dagestan.
   Nests of H. astragali are described. Females of this species excavated
   burrows in a vertical clay cliff, but sometimes chose a horizontal
   surface for nest excavation, particularly at the entrance of old burrows
   of Xylocopa olivieri (Apidae). The nest burrows of H. astragali were
   either sub-vertical or sub-horizontal. The nests were composed of one to
   three brood cells, an empty vestibule in front of the outermost cell,
   and a closing plug at the nest entrance made of moistened mud. The inner
   surface of the cells was covered with a thin wall composed of compact
   soil, most probably built by the female bee after cell excavation. The
   pollen loaf was very liquid and had a spherical shape. The egg was
   deposited on its top. The cocoon consisted of a single thin layer, which
   uniformly covered the whole inner surface of the cell. There was one
   generation per year. The prepupae hibernated. Sapyga caucasica
   (Sapygidae) was recorded in the nests as a kleptoparasite. Both females
   and males of H. astragali exclusively visited flowers of two species of
   the genus Astragalus (Fabaceae).},

Abstract = {The work is devoted to the estimation of microalgae resource potential
   for bio-oil production. We propose a method of climate and
   infrastructural factors spatial analysis for estimations of resource and
   the possibility of bio-oil production facilities construction in the
   study region. The resource potential depends on the area of the
   territory that can be used to produce biomass as feedstock for biofuel
   production, and equal to the amount of microalgae biomass that can be
   obtained on this territory. For the case study we selected the territory
   of the Republic of Dagestan (Russia) and microalgae Arthrospira
   platensis and Dunaliella salina. As an infrastructural factors, which
   may reduce the cost of bio-oil production we considered the following
   sources of cheap material resources and energy: seawater (as a source of
   macro- and microelements), geothermal water (as low-temperature heat
   source), CO2 emissions of cement plants and combined heat and power
   plants (as carbon source and to reduce CO2 emission). The analyses of
   these factors using the technology of geoinformation systems allowed to
   find the most suitable territories for microalgae plant allocation and
   therefore estimate resource potential for bio-oil production with
   maximum profit.},

Abstract = {Aim. To analyse seasonal changes in the frequency characteristics of
   wind speed and direction in coastal Dagestan, namely the urban districts
   of the cities of Makhachkala and Derbent, from the point of view of wind
   power potential.
   Material and Methods. The research was based on time series of wind
   speed and direction for the period 2011-2018, obtained as a result of
   observations at the Makhachkala and Derbent weather stations. As a
   mathematical research tool, a continuous wavelet transform with a
   complex Morlet wavelet function was used.
   Results. According to the results of analysis, it was found that the
   main frequency of fluctuations in the time series is one day and one-day
   periodicity in the time series has pronounced seasonal changes. Also,
   differences in seasonal changes of one-day periodicity for wind speed
   and direction between the regions of Makhachkala and Derbent were
   established and described.
   Conclusion. The parameters considered in assessing seasonal changes in
   the dynamics of wind speed and direction can be used as additional
   parameters for the classification and clustering of regions to identify
   the best areas of wind power potential.},

Abstract = {Wheat is a leading poaceae grain crop of the South of Russia. The value
   of wheat is that it contains gluten, which is essential for bread and
   bakery products, pasta, but its yield remains at the level of 2.5-3.0
   t/ha, although its potential is much higher. One of the reasons lies in
   the inefficient use of recommendations on energy-saving technologies
   with the introduction of calculated norms of fertilizers and increased
   requirements for the selection of recommended or regionalized
   complex-resistant crop varieties with high potential productivity,
   product quality, the ability to withstand adverse environmental
   conditions and efficiency to use soil and climatic resources in the
   region. High-quality grain production is the basis of agricultural
   policy of our country. The level of grain production currently does not
   meet the country's needs in providing with high-quality
   environmentally-friendly food grain. Opportunities to improve the
   structure of areas under wheat are reduced from year to year. In this
   regard, the increase in the gross grain harvest is possible by
   increasing the productivity of crops. Modern science and best practices
   in the European countries show that the rational use of land, the use of
   advanced technology improve soil fertility and productivity of crops,
   respectively {[}1,2]. Improvement of the highly efficient technological
   methods for flat lands of Dagestan which can ensure the preservation and
   improvement of soil fertility and on this basis the product quality
   while reducing energy and economic cost is an actual problem of modern
   agricultural production. Winter wheat occupies a leading position in the
   agricultural sector of the Republic of Dagestan, so increasing its yield
   and production of environmentally-friendly products, based on the
   rational use of mineral fertilizers is closely linked with the
   development of fertilizer systems. The introduction of calculated doses
   of mineral fertilizers into the soil balances the productivity of winter
   wheat at a high level. Land resources of Dagestan diverse in
   agro-climatic and soil resources, which affects the productivity of
   winter wheat. The need for a precise definition of the of mineral
   nutrition norms for winter wheat in the conditions of the flat zone of
   Dagestan determines its relevance and national economic importance.
   Based on the above-mentioned, the main objective of agricultural
   producers in the production of grain is high yields of high quality
   products while ensuring the oil fertility, and excluding the negative
   impact on the environment. Compensate the removal of nutrients is
   possible through the application of mineral fertilizers, and the latter
   is reflected on the quality of the grain. In our paper, we present the
   results of research on the effect of mineral fertilizers on the yield
   and quality of winter wheat. In particular, we have studied the effect
   of mineral fertilizers rates on the dynamics of the protein content, wet
   gluten and nitrates in the winter wheat grain {[}8,11,12].},

Title = {BETWEEN <i>THE NORTH</i> AND <i>THE LAND</i>: ROAD FROM WEST SIBERIA TO
   DAGESTAN AS AN ELEMENT OF SOCIAL SPACE OF TRANSLOCAL MIGRANT},
Journal = {SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},

Pages = {26-34},
Abstract = {The cities of oil and gas region of West Siberia have been the centers
   of attraction for migrants from the former Soviet Union for the past 60
   years. One of the most important migratory flows in the region since the
   late Soviet time comes from the Russian Caucasus and migrants from the
   Republic of Dagestan make up a noticeable percentage of it. Analysis of
   the data from the field work (2011-2016), allows to characterize
   Dagestanian migration to Khanty-Mansiysk District as translocal, when
   migrants develop and maintain multiple economic and social relations
   simultaneously in the sending and receiving societies and thus belongs
   to multiple geographic localities. I offer insight into practices of
   migrants through the lens of the idea of translocal social space. To
   explain the nature of this translocal case it is necessary to show the
   specifics of rural communities of Dagestan as one of the most relevant
   social structure in the republic. In the article I describe the
   movements which take place there as relevant social practices making
   this type of migration translocal trade activity, packages, people and
   dead bodies transportation. Migrants create demand for the regional
   products of home land as well as provide a demand. When transporting
   goods, not only economic benefits become important, but also regional
   preferences of the donor region. Solving the problems of transporting
   the dead bodies addresses the issue of consolidation of compatriots.
   Besides I pay attention to the specificity of migrant infrastructure of
   roads between a Northern city and a Dagestanian village as a part of
   translocal social space.},

Abstract = {Aim. Determination of phytocenosis productivity, nitrogen concentration
   and reserves in blocks of plant associations and by soil types in the
   North-Western Precaspian region of Russia. Methods. Comprehensive
   research on the accumulation of organic matter and nitrogen in five
   blocks of plant matter, six plant associations and three types of soil
   by season using well-known methods of accounting and analysis of soils
   and plants.Results. The regularities of phytomass formation, changes in
   nitrogen concentration and reserves in the main soil types and six plant
   associations for the 2011-2018 seasons were revealed. Conclusions.
   Ephemeroid-wormwood-cereal, ephemeroid-wormwood, cereal-wormwood,
   forb-campfire and mixed-grass-campfire plant communities formed on light
   chestnut soil are the most productive, with a total productivity of
   24.34 t/ha. The maximum nitrogen concentration was observed in the
   cereal-wormwood, wormwood-saltwort, forb-saltwort and cereal-saltwort
   associations - 1.9, 1.97, 2.2, and 2.57\%, respectively, which is due to
   the predominance of Artemisia taurica Willd., Artemisia lercheana Web.ex
   Stechm. and Salsola iberica Sennen \& Pau. In associations where there
   are representatives of the Poaceae, Brassicaceae and Caryophyllaceae,
   nitrogen decreases to 1.72-1.74\%. Its value was higher on
   light-chestnut soil, being 1.82\% of absolutely dry mass, while on
   meadow-chestnut soil it decreased to 1.75 and on saline soil is
   typically 1.38\%. In the root mass of plant associations, its indicators
   were 3.2 times less than in the above ground mass. Nitrogen reserves by
   blocks of plant matter formed the following decreasing series: roots >\_
   green mass >\_ rags >\_ felt. In the input part of the balance in plant
   associations, 171.6 nitrogen accumulates on light-chestnut soil, 63.1 on
   meadow-chestnut soil, 49.1 kg/ha on automorphic typical saline soil, and
   171.9; 64.3 and 58.1 kg/ha in the expenditure part, respectively. the
   balance of nitrogen in the first type of soil is formed with a minimum
   deficit of 0.6 kg/ha, 1.2 and 9 kg/ha, respectively.},

   4897 g/L, near-neutral brine pH, and sulfide concentration of similar to
   1 mM. The temperature at the stream bottom was as high as 60 degrees C.
   Elevated temperature and high salinity limited the development of
   phototrophic communities. Formation of cyanobacterial mats occurred at
   temperatures below 54 degrees C. Phormidium-like cyanobacteria and
   unicellular Synechocystis sp. predominated in the mats. The number of
   cyanobacterial species increased at desalination to 4857 g/L with
   emergence of the species morphologically resembling Spirulina sp.,
   Leptolyngbya sp., and Oscillatoria sp. Among anoxygenic phototrophic
   bacteria, halophilic purple bacteria Ectothiorhodospira sp.,
   Marichromatium sp., and Rhodovulum sp., green sulfur bacteria
   Prosthecochloris sp., and unidentified Chloroflexi were present.
   Oxygenic photosynthesis in the mats was not inhibited by sulfide.
   Production of cyanobacterial mats was up to 4.753.8 mu g/(cm(2) h). The
   contribution of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria to photosynthetic
   production varied from 0 to 100\%. The composition of this microbial
   community was compared to those of the phototrophic microbial
   communities of the mesothermal springs of the Dead Sea coast (Israel),
   the Washington warm lake (United States), and the Paoha Island hot
   springs (Mono Lake, United States.},

Title = {Analysis of polymorphisms in genes associated with milk productivity in

Abstract = {Aim. The unique gene pool of indigenous breeds in the Dagestan Caucasus
   is threatened by the increasingly widespread use of commercial breeds,
   which in turn risks narrowing the genetic base necessary to increase and
   maintain existing genetic diversity. For this reason, our research aimed
   to study the polymorphism of the PRL, PIT-1, GH genes in red steppe and
   Caucasian brown cattle raised in the conditions of Dagestan.
   Methods. Genotyping of red steppe and Caucasian brown cattle was carried
   out using PCR-RFLP methods. Using these methods, genetic analysis was
   carried out and polymorphism of the prolactin, somatotropin and
   pituitary-specific transcription factor genes was studied.
   Results. As a result of the genotyping of an experimental group of red
   steppe cattle, it was found that the distribution of two alleles and
   three genotypes (PIT-1A and PIT-1B; PIT-1AA, PIT-1BB, PIT-1AB) of the
   PIT-1 gene has a specific character. The specificity of the allelic
   spectrum of the PRL gene is expressed in the high (0.84) frequency of
   occurrence of the PRLA allele and low (0.16) frequency of the PRLB
   allele. This is reflected in the presence of homo- and heterozygous
   genotypes with a frequency of occurrence of 73.0; 23.0; 4.0 \%,
   respectively.
   Conclusion. Applied genetic approaches to improve the productive and
   breed qualities of livestock, which are modern and based on a more
   complete analysis of the genetic diversity and genotype of the studied
   populations, contribute to the conservation of zoned breeds. At the same
   time, intrapopulation variability and good adaptability should ensure
   the sustainable development of dairy cattle breeding in various climatic
   zones.},

Abstract = {Modern manifestation of desertification stages and of arid degradation
   and the dynamics of the development of these processes depending on soil
   fertility under arid conditions are analyzed based on the example of
   some areas of the Western Caspian Sea Region: the Terek-Kuma Lowland and
   the Terek River delta. There are two stages of the development of
   degradation processes, which strongly differ in their combination and
   area distribution. The first stage, natural degradation, starts from the
   development of soil-forming processes in the Holocene as one of the
   obligatory elements of the functioning of living organisms on the Earth
   surface. The natural dynamics of degradation processes results in the
   formation of an equilibrium status of formation of soils of particular
   types with a complete profile structure. Depending on soil-forming
   conditions typical for degradation (salinization, pollution,
   solonetzicity of soils at different stages of their evolution),
   solonchaks, solonetzes, and sand and clay deserts are formed. These soil
   properties continue to develop under natural conditions at the present
   time and their evolution that started in the Holocene goes on (Akaev,
   1996). At the second stage, the dynamics of arid degradation and
   desertification is caused by the anthropogenic impact and radically
   differs from the natural degradation. As a result of the increased
   anthropogenic load, the natural soil cover is replaced by an unstable
   secondary one under man-made conditions. The development of new
   directions of soil formation is favored by the expansion of irrigated
   lands in the Terek River delta, the Terek-Kuma Lowland, and other
   regions and by the subject of cultivated soils to salinization, wind
   erosion, and degradation.},

Abstract = {Aim. The widespread use of so-called commercial breeds leads to the loss
   of a unique gene pool of native breeds and the narrowing of the genetic
   base that is necessary to preserve and to increase the genetic diversity
   of cattle breeds which are still preserved. These breeds include the
   Caucasian Brown. In connection , the aim of this research was to study
   the polymorphism of PIT-1, PRL and GH genes in dairy cattle bred in
   different ecological climatic zones of the Republic of Dagestan to
   identify the genotypes of carriers of selection-significant marker
   alleles for their preservation and further use in the selection process.
   Material and Methods. Genotyping of the Caucasian brown breed cows bred
   in different natural climatic zones was carried out using PCR-RFLP
   methods. The polymorphism of PIT-1, PRL and GH genes was studied,
   population analysis of their distribution in the cattle stock studied
   was carried out and the features of the genetic structure in the
   researched populations were studied in relation to the conditions of
   their habitat.
   Results. The specific allelic PIT-1, PRL, and GH gene spectrum,
   characteristic for each animal population studied has been established.
   Homozygous and heterozygous carrier genotypes of the desired marker
   alleles with frequency of occurrence depending on both the gene and the
   animal population were identified. The genetic structural features of
   the genes studied in the researched populations were revealed.
   Conclusion. The data obtained indicate the genetic uniqueness of the
   Caucasian Brown breed bred in different natural climatic zones in the
   Republic of Dagestan and are probably associated with the manifestation
   of adaptations, the nature of which has developed under the influence of
   the prevailing ecological, natural climatic conditions of its habitat.},

Title = {THE CHOKH ARCHAEOLOGICAL CULTURE: COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF BASIC
   COMPONENTS},
Journal = {KRATKIE SOOBSHCHENIYA INSTITUTA ARKHEOLOGII},

Number = {271},
Pages = {7-23},
Abstract = {The Chokh archaeological culture is a specific local formation
   characterized by impressive technological and typological features
   chronologically tied to the Mesolithic and Neolithic of Inner Dagestan.
   At the Neolithic stage this culture manifests itself as a
   multi-component formation composed of three diverse components. The
   triunity in this combination is unique for the Caucasus. One of the key
   components of this culture is flint industry. Its striking originality
   is emphasized by such cultural elements as small Levallois flat cores
   for flakes and four variants of points (arrowheads) of the Chokh type.
   These specific features emerged in the culture of Inner Dagestan as
   early as the Mesolithic and, without any major changes, persisted in the
   areas of medium-to-high plateaus (around 1200-1800 m above the sea
   level) and intermountain valleys. The second component of the Neolithic
   Chokh culture is reflected in ceramics which typologically and
   technologically coincide with the ceramics known in the early farming
   culture of the eastern Trans-Caucasus region (Shulaveri-Shomutepe).
   Finally, the third component is the method of exerting manual pressure
   (using a lever pressure device?) employed to obtain standardized
   microblades. Each of the described cultural components has its own
   source and/or direction of cultural links and external influences. Local
   genetic roots are traced only for the above-said specific features of
   lithic industry. Technical and typological traits of ceramics point to
   links between the Chokh population and the groups attributed to the
   Trans-Caucasus Shulaveri-Shomutepe culture. The northern vector of
   cultural impacts (northern relative to the Dagestan region), which is
   opposite to the eastern Trans-Caucasus direction of contacts, manifests
   itself in the method of exerting manual pressure in flint knapping that
   was introduced in the technological arsenal of the mountainous Neolithic

Title = {Aggregation Formation in Chestnut and Meadow-Chestnut Soils of the
   Terek-Sulak Plain and Its Impact on Their Agrophysical Properties},

Abstract = {The physical properties of plowed and fallow chestnut and
   meadow-chestnut soils were studied in the Terek-Sulak Plain. It is shown
   that soil density depends both on the aggregate size and specific
   features of the soil formation process. In each particular case, this
   dependence is closely linked to the soil genesis and agricultural use.
   Analysis of the aggregate porosity estimated based on the percentage
   content of fractions shows that the major share of interaggregate
   porosity is attributed to large aggregates. The results can be
   extrapolated to other parts of the soil cover in the study area. On each
   studied site, an experimental soil profile cut was established, the
   morphological soil properties were described, and soil samples were
   taken layer by layer (cm) from horizons A, B-1, B-2, and C-1 (A(plow),
   arable layer) for chestnut soils and from horizons A, B-1, and C-1 for
   meadow-chestnut soils. The structure index was computed based on the the
   sifting data as the ratio between the sum of macroaggregates (0.25-10 mm
   in size) and the sum of aggregates with diameters of more than 10 mm and
   less than 0.25 mm. The porosity of aggregate fractions 7-5, 5-3, 3-2,
   2-1, 1-0.5, and 0.5-0.25 mm in size was determined from randomly
   selected samples of the respective fractions. Mechanical sampling was
   used to ensure the random selection of samples for analysis. In all of
   studied soils, the porosity of aggregates of the same size decreases
   down the profile. The sharpest decrease is observed in large (7-5 mm)
   aggregates: their porosity drops from 37\% in horizon A to 31\% in
   horizon C-1. In small aggregates, this trend is manifested not so
   clearly. In chestnut soils, aggregate porosity gradually decreases with
   depth, while the minimum porosity in meadow-chestnut soils is observed
   in the B-1 and C-1 horizons. This pattern is manifested most clearly in
   aggregates 2-1 mm in size. However, the minimum aggregate porosity in
   horizon B-1 is pronounced quite clearly not only in the 2-1 mm fraction
   but also in all other fractions up to 7-5 mm in size. In the C-1
   horizon, the aggregate porosity drops to almost identical values that
   are close to the computed close-packed porosity (a method involving
   mutual coupling of mineral particles in a clastic rock). Earlier studies
   have shown that aggregate porosity is closely linked to the soil
   composition, structure, and origin, as well as the general soil genesis
   that determines the fertility.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of the work is to identify prospects for an
   effective system of expanded agricultural reproduction for the
   sustainable development of the agricultural sector of the economy.
   Design/methodology/approach: To measure the effectiveness of the
   extended reproduction system in agriculture, an author's methodological
   approach has been developed, within the framework of which an evaluation
   formula and a scale are proposed to interpret the effectiveness of
   extended reproduction in agriculture. Findings: The authors conducted an
   applied research of the effectiveness of the system of extended
   reproduction in agriculture at the level of the global agricultural
   sector. Statistics for 2019-2020 were analyzed and the effectiveness of
   extended reproduction in agriculture was evaluated using the author's
   methodological approach. Alternative approaches to expanded reproduction
   in agriculture were identified and their comparative analysis from the
   point of view of efficiencywas carried out using the Game
   Theorymethodology. Originality/value: Thus, the formation of an
   effective system of expanded reproduction in agriculture as a
   prerequisite for the sustainable development of the agricultural sector
   of the economy involves a transition to the path of intensive
   development of this sector. The current extensive development of
   agriculture causes a decrease in its commercial attractiveness and is
   associated with negative efficiency (0.97 in 2020). To increase
   efficiency, the modernization of the agricultural sector based on
   digital technologies is recommended. Thanks to this, a new source of
   expanded reproduction will be available - increasing the productivity of
   agriculture based on automation. This will increase efficiency to 1.44.},

   in comparison with trees growing on plains; the apricot and apple trees
   growing on lower foothills concentrate more Ca and P, while the contents
   of K, Na, Mg, and Cu in their fruits are reduced. Plants of the same
   species growing on soils with different contents of mineral substances
   differ by the total content of macro-and microelements in their fruits
   but accumulate roughly equivalent levels of P, Na, Ca, Cu, Ni, and Pb.},

Title = {THE ROLE OF AMANATSTVO IN POLITICAL CONTACTS OF KUMYK FEUDAL HEADS WITH
   RUSSIA DURING THE 18TH CENTURY (BY KIZLYAR COMMANDANT ARCHIVE MATERIALS)},
Journal = {TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},

Pages = {86-89},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The article based on the analysis of Kizlyar Commandant archive
   materials discusses the place and importance of Amanatstvo in the
   relationship of Kumyk feudal lords with Russia in the 18th century. In
   the period under review Amanatstvo was very common both in the political
   life of the peoples of Dagestan and in the relationship of Kumyk feudal
   lords with the Russian Empire. The institution of Amanatstvo has its
   roots in ancient times; in the investigated period it was widespread in
   many countries of the East as well as in the Caucasus. The term
   ``Amanat{''} is of Arabic origin and means hostage or pledge issued by
   the defeated party in order to make peace with its enemy. There is no
   doubt that Amanatstvo played an important role in the political
   orientation of Kumyk feudal lords towards Russia. In the hands of the
   Caucasian rulers Amanatstvo was a reliable means of political coercion
   and subjugation of the mountain rulers to the foreign policy that was
   carried out up to the conquest of the Caucasus. It was a time-tested
   tool to regulate the political turmoil and to get the oath of allegiance
   to the king from Kumyk princes. Throughout the 18th century Kumyk feudal
   lords, leading a fierce infighting, sought support from the royal court
   counting to win over each other with the help of the Russian troops. For
   this, they expressed their willingness to serve Russia faithfully; they
   supported by oaths and issued their sons, brothers or nephews as
   hostages. The tsarist autocracy interested in consolidating their
   position and stability in the Caucasus region was well aware of the role
   the hostage could play in this process and drew maximal benefits from
   this situation. With the entry of Kumyk fiefdoms to Russian citizenship,
   Amanatstvo turned into a system that was used as a reliable guarantor of
   loyalty of Kumyk princes to the Imperial throne. With the founding of
   the fortress of Kizlyar in 1735, all hostages were transferred here. A
   special court was built here, where relatives of the North Caucasian
   rulers lived.},

Title = {CHANGES IN THE MOISTURE OF THE CASPIAN REGION OF RUSSIA DUE TO GLOBAL

Abstract = {Since the end of the twentieth century, the climate system of the planet
   has been experiencing significant changes in air temperature, due to
   anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and
   changes in the precipitation regime. Our research covers the Caspian
   region of Russia, which belongs to the southern regions of the country,
   where one of the highest rates of air temperature increase is observed.
   The Caspian region includes the Astrakhan region, Kalmykia and Dagestan.
   To assess the upcoming changes, the average daily air temperature and
   precipitation were taken, as well as the average monthly values of water
   vapor elasticity, total cloud cover for the points of Astrakhan, Elista,
   Yashkul, Lagan, Makhachkala, Buinaksk, Derbent and Akhty. To assess
   changes in natural areas, we used the Budyko radiation dryness index.
   Changes in agriculture were estimated using the Selyaninov
   hydro-climatic index. It was revealed that the upcoming changes in the
   climate system, based on the data of the ensemble of models (CMIP5),
   will lead to an increase in the radiation balance, in the average annual
   amount of precipitation, in the sum of temperatures of more than 10
   degrees C by the end of the century. Analysis of the dynamics of the
   Budyko index showed that by the end of this century, the Astrakhan
   region will still belong to the zone of subtropical deserts. Depending
   on which climate scenario the global climate system will develop, the
   region of Kalmykia may move from the zone of subtropical deserts to the
   zone of subtropical semi-deserts. The territory of Dagestan currently
   belongs to the zone of subtropical semi-desert. With the development of
   the climate scenario RCP 4.5, this territory will tend to the climatic
   conditions of the subtropical steppe zone (K = 2-3). In the development
   of the RCP8. 5 scenario, the territory of Dagestan will remain a zone of
   subtropical semi-deserts, with a tendency to transition to a zone of
   subtropical steppes. The readings of the Selyaninov hydro-climatic
   index, calculated for the period 2011-2030, indicate a continued
   deterioration of the moisture turnover conditions for the Astrakhan
   region and Dagestan in all scenarios. The humidity regime of the
   Astrakhan region will gradually deteriorate. As a result, irrigation -
   type agriculture will dominate in the Astrakhan region, while dry
   agriculture will dominate in Dagestan. According to the RCP 2.6 and RCP
   8.5 scenarios, Kalmykia will move from an irrigation farming zone to a
   dry farming zone. By the end of the century, the humidity conditions of
   the Astrakhan region and Dagestan will deteriorate even more. The
   Astrakhan region and Dagestan will remain in the zone of irrigation and
   dry farming, respectively. Kalmykia, according to the RCP 2.6 scenario,
   remains in the dry farming zone by the end of the century, according to
   the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, it again passes into the irrigation
   zone. It is obvious that some improvement associated with an increase in
   the amount of precipitation per year will contribute to the favorable
   development of natural systems (with a tendency to move from deserts to
   semi-deserts). At the same time, the conditions for the development of
   agriculture in most part of the Caspian region will deteriorate.},

Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},

Volume = {13},

Pages = {156-164},
Abstract = {The article discusses the land-use problem of mountain and semi-desert
   landscapes of Dagestan caused by the need to improve the ecologization
   of traditional pastures as well as perspective tourism and recreational
   land use. Aim. A comprehensive geographic study of land use in the
   republic is crucial for the formation of ecologically sustainable
   distillation and nomad livestock and tourist-recreational land use on
   the natural, zonal and high-belt mountain-semi-desert landscapes that
   are not fully developed and are not suitable for farming. Discussion.
   Ecological and economic effects are revealed due to the combined use of
   semi-desert-mountain pastures and tourist-recreational areas represented
   by the population carrying capacity, the ecologization of pasture land
   use and a significant increase in the total livestock production.
   Improved combined interzonal use of lands with different natural rhythms
   of vegetation development contributes, first of all, to maintaining the
   equilibrium and integrity of the regional ecological system; secondly,
   to the ecological orientation of pasture-livestock and
   tourist-recreational land use; and thirdly, to the restoration and the
   functioning of the quality of natural semi-desert and mountain pasture
   lands. Conclusion. Ecological and landscape improvement within mountain
   pasture land use is proposed on the basis of the ecological and economic
   efficiency of the annual cycle of high-altitude sheep keeping with the
   regular change of pasture lands of different productivity levels by
   different sex and age groups of pastured livestock.},

Abstract = {Climate is a modulator of the biological potential of grapes and wine
   products. The present study considers the climate gradient of the
   terroir of the Derbent district (Mugarty village) of the Republic of
   Dagestan, located on the terraced accumulative-coastal plain of the
   Caspian Lowland, extending for 160 km from north to south in a narrow
   strip between the coast of the Caspian Sea and the foothills. The paper
   studies the influence of soil and climate conditions on the physical and
   chemical properties; flavor characteristics; mineral, vitamin-like and
   phenolic substances of red dry wines from Cabernet-Sauvignon grapes of
   the 2019 - 2020 harvest. The vegetation period of the grapevine took
   place in a dry, moderately humid climate in 2019 and hot, with a large
   amount of precipitation climate in 2020. The conditions of recent years
   have contributed to the improvement of almost all the studied indicators
   of dry red wines. Regardless of the changing climatic conditions of this
   period, terroir wines had their unique feature of aroma and taste. New
   data show a significant role of the biochemically active S. cerevisiae
   Y-4270 strain in the creation of high-quality dry red wines.},

Abstract = {Aim. The aim of the research is to study the influence of various
   environmental factors (abiotic and biotic) on some fish-biological
   indicators in the cultivation of sturgeons with the use of a
   recirculating aquaculture system (RAS). Methods. A complete biological
   analysis was carried out according to the generally accepted
   ichthyological methods. Monitoring of the hydrochemical regime in the
   RAS was carried out throughout the study period. The temperature and pH
   of water were measured daily and the concentration of oxygen in the
   basins was measured three times a day. Results. Taking into account that
   the fish specimens studied did not show any pathology and also taking
   into consideration their genetic homogeneity and absolutely identical
   conditions in the RAS, the findings obtained can be explained by the
   different degree of oxygen supply under artificial growth conditions.
   The results of the biochemical analysis show that the blood of fish
   grown in the RAS with an elevated oxygen content (experimental group) by
   the end of the experiment (4 weeks) contains an increased amount of
   malondialdehyde (MDA) which could lead to the observed difference in the
   dynamics of growth parameters of the young of the year. Conclusions.
   When the oxygen content of the water is below 70\% the growth rate slows
   down, as food consumption is almost halved, while the saturation of O-2
   by 40\% is considered critical. When sterlet is grown to produce a high
   mass, it is necessary to set the temperature of the water in the pools
   in the interval of 21-220 degrees C in the ultrasonic complexes. For
   industrial cultivation of sterlet, we recommend using a planting density
   of 60 kg/m(3) .},

Abstract = {The article presents the results of a study on the content of arsenic,
   lead, cadmium and mercury in water, soil and in plant products that are
   directly used by humans for nutrition.
   During four years of observation, water analysis demonstrates high
   arsenic concentrations. The arsenic content ranges from 0.033 to 0.048
   mclkg versus 0.01 MAC and exceeds almost 3.3-5 times. Lead content
   exceeds 10 times.
   In the course of the research, it was found that artesian water is the
   source of arsenic contamination of plant foods with arsenic. For many
   years, artesian water has been used by the population to irrigate
   cultivated plants.
   Arsenic is intensively accumulated by many plants: 9 out of 20 have its
   concentration above the maximum permissible.
   It was found that the most actively absorb and accumulate arsenic figs,
   potatoes and cucumber. The high content of lead is dominated in parsley,
   dill and watercress salad.
   All detected elements have a cumulative and toxic effect and are
   carcinogenic and belong to the first class of danger.
   Arsenic is a substance that has both carcinogenic and pronounced general
   toxic effects.
   With this in mind, scientists have identified correlations between
   oncological disease and the use of water containing elevated
   concentrations of arsenic as sources (Alissa, Ferns, 2011;
   Gasanguseinava, 2010; 2018 Putilova, 2006; Ashurbekova et al., 2018).
   Comparison of the results of artesian water studies used in the
   Terek-Kumsky basin for domestic water supply, conducted earlier at the
   Institute of Geology, DSC of RAS, and the results of our research show
   that the constant chemical composition of artesian water remains, the
   arsenic content exceeds the maximum permissible concentrations of WHO
   average 10.0 - 20.0 times, according to GOST - an average of 1.8-2.0
   times.},

   genomic properties of lytic rhizobiophage AP-J-162 isolated from the
   soils of the mountainous region of Dagestan (North Caucasus), which
   belongs to the centers of origin of cultivated plants, according to
   Vavilov N.I. The rhizobiophage host strains are nitrogen-fixing bacteria
   of the genus Sinorhizobium spp., symbionts of leguminous forage grasses.
   The phage particles have a myovirus virion structure. The genome of
   rhizobiophage AP-J-162 is double-stranded DNA of 471.5 kb in length; 711
   ORFs are annotated and 41 types of tRNAs are detected. The closest
   phylogenetic relative of phage AP-J-162 is Agrobacterium phage Atu-ph07,
   but no rhizobiophages are known. The replicative machinery, capsid, and
   baseplate proteins of phage AP-J-162 are structurally similar to those
   of Escherichia phage T4, but there is no similarity between their tail
   protein subunits. Amino acid sequence analysis shows that 339 of the
   ORFs encode hypothetical or functionally relevant products, while the
   remaining 304 ORFs are unique. Additionally, 153 ORFs are similar to
   those of Atu\_ph07, with one-third of the ORFs encoding different
   enzymes. The biological properties and genomic characteristics of phage
   AP-J-162 distinguish it as a unique model for exploring phage-microbe
   interactions with nitrogen-fixing symbiotic microorganisms.},

Abstract = {The study of comparative agrobiological characteristics of productivity
   elements and their conjugation among various sort samples of huskless
   and filmed forms of oats was carried out under the conditions of the
   Republic of Dagestan.
   In the Republic of Dagestan, oats one of the promising grain fodder and
   fodder crops. The interest in this culture is explained by high feed
   qualities of grain, vegetative mass and protein content.
   The study of correlation links showed that the main structural elements
   of head productivity, of which the final result is developed i.e. a
   crop, closely interact with each other positively. The revealed negative
   interrelationships of 1000 grain weight with the head length and the
   number of grains among huskless oats confirm our conclusion about the
   expediency of breeding-valuable genotypes search and selection according
   to this feature.
   AS-7 was revealed among the studied varieties of oats and among film
   forms in terms of productivity, and Aldan among huskless forms, both
   from Kemerovo region.},

Title = {Maternal Origins and Haplotype Diversity of Seven Russian Goat
   Populations Based on the D-loop Sequence Variability},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Russia has diverse specifically selected and multipurpose
   goat resources. However, the origin of the local goats is still
   enigmatic. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) fragments of seven Russian local goat populations to provide the
   first insight into their maternal lineage. The territory of modern
   Russia lies on the crossroads of East and West and covers various
   geographical environments where diverse groups of local goats
   originated. In this work, we present the first study on the maternal
   origin of Russian local goats, including Altai Mountain (n= 9), Dagestan
   Downy (n= 18), Dagestan Local (n= 12), Dagestan Milk (n= 15), Karachaev
   (n= 21), Orenburg (n= 10), and Soviet Mohair (n= 7) breeds, based on 715
   bp D-loop mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences. Saanen goats (n= 5) were
   used for comparison. Our findings reveal a high haplotype (HD =
   0.843-1.000) and nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.0112-0.0261). A total of
   59 haplotypes were determined in the Russian goat breeds, in which all
   differed from the haplotypes of the Saanen goats. The haplotypes
   identified in Altai Mountain, Orenburg, Soviet Mohair, and Saanen goats
   were breed specific. Most haplotypes (56 of 59) were clustered together
   with samples belonging to haplogroup A, which was in accordance with the
   global genetic pattern of maternal origin seen in most goats worldwide.
   The haplotypes that were grouped together with rare haplogroups D and G
   were found in the Altai Mountain breed and haplogroup C was detected in
   the Soviet Mohair breed. Thus, our findings revealed that local goats
   might have been brought to Russia via various migration routes. In
   addition, haplotype sharing was found in aboriginal goat populations
   from overlapping regions, which might be useful information for their
   official recognition status.},

Abstract = {The areas between Dagestan to Talysh, in the Trans-Caucasia and north of
   Iran are the central regions of quince (Cydonia oblonga Mill.) origin.
   Historic documents present evidences of quince domestication in the
   Mesopotamia, between 5000 and 4000 BC that have been pursued to about
   500 BC in the ancient Persian and Greek empires. By the end of
   nineteenth century, domesticated populations of this plant had been
   spread to the west and east Asia, Europe and America which in turn,
   created several centers of diversity along its distribution route in
   some regions such as plateau of Iran, Anatolia, Greece and southern
   Europe, north of the Black Sea and Russia. Gradually in the mentioned
   domestication routes, selected quinces such as, Isfahan, Smyrna, Ekmek,
   Eme, Vranja, Lescovatz and Champion have become commercialized as
   superior cultivars. Also genebank collections of the historic cultivars
   together with the promising genotypes of quince have been established in
   several countries including, Russia, Iran, Turkey, Greece, Italy,
   Bulgaria, Czech Republic, UK and USA. Investigations on morphological,
   molecular and horticultural characteristics of the germplasm have
   provided ample opportunities for application of advanced breeding
   programs especially to boost bearing potential, induce dwarfing,
   increase fruit quality and resistance to the main diseases such as fire
   blight. This review paper has attempted to give an account for quince
   historic origin, domestication, gene bank collections and breeding
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Aim. Polymorphism is the result of evolutionary processes and is
   inherited, associated with biodiversity and modified by natural
   selection and functions to preserve various forms of population. It is
   economically advantageous to find genes that can be used in breeding in
   such a way as to increase the fertility of animals in different natural
   geographical zones, since the adaptive abilities of organisms are
   complicated. In this regard, the purpose of this study was to study the
   genetic potential of sheep of different breeds bred in various
   ecological and geographical regions of the North Caucasus with
   pasture-pasture and pasture-stall conditions of sheep breeding.
   Material and Methods. Genotyping was undertaken of sheep of different
   breeds contained in various natural and climatic zones of the Republic
   of Dagestan and the most arid region of Stavropol Territory in the zone
   of risky agriculture where the climate is sharply continental.
   Genotyping in the loci of the genes of differential growth factor (GDF9)
   and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP15) was carried out by PCR-PDRF
   (polymorphism of the lengths of restriction fragments) by cutting DNA
   using endonuclease restriction and further analysis of the size of the
   resulting PCR fragments. The genetic structure of genes has been studied
   by methods of genetic and statistical analysis of the data obtained.
   Conclusion. The genetic structure of sheep populations of different
   breeds bred in the foothills of the Republic of Dagestan and the arid
   region of Stavropol Territory was studied for the first time.
   Information obtained on the role of the degree of genetic variability of
   sheep of different breeds provides data which can contribute to the
   ecological well-being of herds and the status characterising the signs
   of multiple birth rates is also determined. This will further improve
   and significantly accelerate breeding work with livestock, since an
   important task of further increasing the efficiency of the industry is
   the reproduction of the herd together with a simultaneous increase in
   the productivity of animals.},

Abstract = {This article considers public opinion in the republic of Dagestan on the
   expansion of hydrocarbon production in the Russian sector of the Caspian
   Sea. The article reports the findings of a survey (N = 956) conducted in
   2010 in fourteen rural locations in the republic. Overall, respondents
   uniformly oppose the proposed expansion of offshore oil and gas
   production in the Russian sector of the Caspian Sea, seeing little
   economic benefit from this development and expressing concern about the
   environmental consequences. These findings resonate with work in
   geography on resource peripheries and development alternatives available
   in these locations.},

Abstract = {Given the lack of reliable first-hand sources, nobody has yet traced the
   modern history of Islamic charitable endowments in the North Caucasus
   under early Soviet rule.. is article is one of the first attempts to
   conduct such research in Daghestan. In this republic waqf foundations
   were legally acknowledged until 23 January 1927, when a decree turned
   them into national state property that would be divided among their
   previous holders in cooperatives and kolkhozes. Is it possible to
   recover the early Soviet history of waqf in the period 1920-1927, when
   it functioned under the protection of state law, while remaining almost
   completely exempt from state control and registration? What can be said
   on competing visions of waqf and its place in the Soviet discourse of
   mountaineers' survival and modernity? What role did it play in the
   countryside on the eve of collectivization? To answer these questions
   the author focuses on village communities which, as he argues,
   constituted crucial level of post-Revolutionary Islamic endowments.. is
   research introduces a unique waqf register of the 1920s from the village
   of Dibgashi. It relies on a broad range of Muslim and Soviet sources in
   the Arabic, Caucasian and Russian languages, including oral histories
   gathered by the author among contemporary villagers in Mountain
   Daghestan.},

   reaction (AR), Complement fixation test (CFT), and IDR with
   O-polysaccharide (OPS) antigen), 496 ewes from a brucellosis-free farm
   and 589 heads from affected farms were examined. The rose-bengal test
   revealed brucellosis in 114 (20.4\%) ewes, second only to the indirect
   hemagglutination reaction. Studies have confirmed the specificity, high
   sensitivity and suitability of the rose-bengal test for the diagnosis of
   brucellosis in small cattle. (C) 2021 INT TRANS J ENG MANAG SCI TECH.},

Abstract = {Weeds are a major yield-limiting factor bedeviling eggplant (Solanum
   melongena L.) production in Russia. This study aimed to determine the
   influence of macronutrient rates and drip irrigation regimes on weed
   flora composition and potential soil contamination by weed seedbanks in
   the eggplant field. Three field experiments were conducted during the
   2019-2021 cropping calendar. Two-factorial field experiments were
   designed in four blocks whereby the composition of weed flora in
   eggplants was examined under the influence of different macronutrient
   rates (40 tons manure and N140P30, 40 tons manure and N320P120K210, and
   control without fertilization), and three thresholds of pre-irrigation
   soil moisture \% least moisture capacity (LMC) (in particular, 70, 80
   and 90\% LMC). The results demonstrated that nutrient rates contributed
   to a significant increase in weed density of 27.1 to 37.6\%, due to an
   increase in the number of annual weeds (annual winter weeds and annual
   early spring weeds), and an increase in soil moisture threshold from 70
   to 90\%. Nevertheless, low moisture availability between the rows as a
   result of drip irrigation utilization led to a decrease in weed
   populations by 10.8 to 15.9\%. Potential contamination of the arable
   soil layer with weed seed was desirably decreased, ranging from 19.8 to
   21.7\% with the application of fertilizers, compared with the control.
   Furthermore, the soil weed seedbank was considerably reduced by an
   increase in the pre-irrigation threshold of soil moisture.},

Abstract = {Local grape cultivars from different countries of the world are an
   important part of the gene pool of this culture. Of particular interest
   are the genotypes of the most ancient regions of viticulture. The
   territories of the subtropical zone of Georgia and the central part of
   Abkhazia belong to one of the centers of origin of the cultural
   grapevine. The purpose of the work was to genotype native Abkhazian
   grape cultivars, to study their genetic diversity based on DNA profiling
   data and to compare them with the genotypes of local varieties of other
   viticultural regions. Samples of plants were taken on the territory of
   the Republic of Abkhazia in private farmsteads and in the collection of
   the agricultural firm ``Vina i Vody Abkhazii{''} ({''}Wines and Waters
   of Abkhazia{''}).The genotyping of the Abkhazian cultivars Avasirhva,
   Agbizh, Azhapsh, Azhizhkvakva, Azhikvaca, Atvizh, Atyrkuazh, Achkykazh,
   Kachich was carried out using 14 DNA markers, 9 of which are standard
   microsatellite markers recommended for the identification of grape
   varieties. To improve our knowledge about the sizes of the identified
   alleles, we used the DNA of grape cultivars with a known allelic
   composition at the analyzed loci. Statistical analysis of the data
   showed that the observed heterozygosity for the analyzed loci exceeded
   expected values, which indicates a genetic polymorphism of the studied
   sample of varieties. Evaluation of genetic similarity within the
   analyzed group based on the results of genotyping at 14 loci showed that
   the cultivars Kachich and Azhapsh differed from the other Abkhazian
   varieties. The obtained DNA profiles of the Abkhazian cultivars were
   checked for compliance with DNA-fingerprints of grape varieties in the
   Vitis International Variety Catalogue. The Georgian varieties
   Azhizhkvakva and Tsitska turned out to be synonyms according to DNA
   profiles, two varieties from the Database (Italian Albana bianca and
   Georgian Ojaleshi) have differences in DNA fingerprints from the
   varieties Atyrkuazh and Azhikvatsa only in one allele, respectively.
   When comparing the identified Abkhazian grape genotypes, their
   difference from the sample of Dagestan, Don, Greek, Turkish, Italian,
   Spanish, and French varieties and genetic similarity with the genotypes
   of Georgian grapes were shown.},

Abstract = {The evaluation of changes occurring in the dynamics of arid lands and
   desertification processes is carried out with regard for the influence
   of the climatic factor on land aridization. The total land area and area
   of arid lands by continent, including the territory of Dagestan and the
   southern regions of Russia, are characterized for the first time. It is
   shown that the problem of arid lands and desertification has both
   scientific and socioeconomic meanings. In different arid and subarid
   zones, the origins and dynamic properties depend on region-wide

Title = {Stalin's Liquidation of Kulaks as Class and Organization of the Process
   of the Soviet Peasantry Proletarianization},
Journal = {HERALD OF AN ARCHIVIST},
Year = {2021},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1229-1244},
Abstract = {The article examines various aspects of the recently revealed archival
   document of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party
   (Bolsheviks) on the plan of repressive policy against the Soviet
   peasantry ``On measures to eliminate kulak farms in the areas of
   continuous collectivization.{''} The author notes that the process of
   liquidation of kulaks as class, or of depeasantrification, as it is
   often designated in the historical literature, has been well studied.
   The first and rather timid attempts to assess the problem in the terms
   of individual ``deformations of socialism{''} date to the turn the
   1990s. At present, the attention is mostly focused on the regional
   aspect, as over the past three decades there has been made available a
   complex of sources from local archives, which was previously in closed
   storage. The article analyzes preconditions of the protest sentiments in
   the course of mass collectivization undertaken by party bodies in the
   center and in the regions, as well as harsh suppression of possible
   peasant uprisings by punitive bodies, identification and persecution of
   the instigators. Examination of official party documents on
   collectivization permits to identify the ideological, social, and
   economic criteria for ranking Soviet peasants among kulaks. It is
   concluded that liquidation of kulaks as class on the territory of the
   USSR was conducted in a very short time and in two stages. At the first
   stage, in January - March 1930, repressions were to be carried out in
   the economically developed regions: the Black Earth region, the Middle
   and Lower Volga region, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus, North Caucasus,
   Dagestan, Ural, Siberia. The second stage spread them to other regions
   of Soviet Russia. The author notes an inconsistency in the thesis of
   positive economic consequences of mass collectivization and elimination
   of kulaks as class for industrialization. Taking into account their
   consequences, the author proposes to consider these two complementary
   processes initiated by the leadership of the CPSU (B) as a preventive
   campaign to intimidate the rural population in order to return to the
   methods of surplus appropriation via formation of the collective farm
   system. It has been revealed that J.V. Stalin's plans, in accordance
   with the Marxist-Leninist doctrine, included a rapid change in
   socio-economic status of peasants: from relatively free farmers,
   producers of agricultural products entitled to manage their crops (after
   paying the taxes) to hired workers, in other words, proletarians.
   According to the author, the large-scale famine of the first half of the
   1930s was a direct consequence of the so-called ``revolutionary
   transformations in agriculture,{''} the victims of which are to be
   accurately calculated.},

Title = {Polymorphism of <i>GH</i>/<i>HaeIII</i> and <i>GDF9</i>/<i>AsplEI</i>
   genes, genetic variation and association of their genotypes with immune
   status in sheep of different breeds ranched in different natural and
   geographic areas},

Abstract = {Aim. One of the important tasks in solving the problem of improving the
   efficiency of sheep breeding is the rational use of fodder lands in the
   North Caucasus and the South of Russia, a significant part of which is
   located in different natural and climatic conditions. The complexity of
   solutions lies in insufficient knowledge of the mechanisms of adaptation
   of farm animals, in particular sheep, to the ecological and geographical
   features of these regions. The purpose of this research was to study the
   genetic polymorphism of genes, the degree of genetic variability and
   immune status in sheep of different breeds, since genetic polymorphism
   is a measure of its adaptability and the hematopoietic function of blood
   is the basis of the life of the organism.
   Material and Methods. The genetic structure of the GH/Hae III,
   GDF9/AsplEI genes and immune status, was studied by the methods of
   genetic-statistical and immune analysis in sheep of different breeds
   kept in different climatic zones of Dagestan and the Krasnodar
   Territory.
   Results. As a result of DNA genotyping of the studied samples of sheep
   of different breeds, it was found that polymorphism of GH/HaeIII,
   GDWAsplEI genes is represented by three genotype variants: homozygous
   GH/HaeIII(AA), GH/HaeIII(BB); GDF9/AsplEI(AA), GDF9/AsplEI(GG);
   heterozygous GH/HaeIII(AB); GDF9/AsplEI(AG) and two alleles: A and B -
   of the GH/HaeIII gene; A and G - GDF9/AsplEI gene with different
   frequency of occurrence, respectively.
   Conclusion. For the first time, genetic variability has been studied in
   the context of the immune status of sheep populations of different
   breeds bred in the foothills of the Republic of Dagestan and Krasnodar
   Territory. The information obtained about the role of the degree of
   genetic variability and the immune status of sheep of different breeds
   is answered in the formation of adaptive-compensatory mechanisms to
   specific conditions of the breeding environment. A deeper study of the
   adaptive characteristics of sheep of different breeds for their further
   improvement allows the use of molecular genetic and hematological
   methods.},

Abstract = {The emergence of farming during the Neolithic transition, including the
   domestication of livestock, was a critical point in the evolution of
   human kind. The goat (Capra hircus) was one of the first domesticated
   ungulates. In this study, we compared the genetic diversity of domestic
   goats to that of the modern representatives of their wild ancestor, the
   bezoar, by analyzing 473 samples collected over the whole distribution
   range of the latter species. This partly confirms and significantly
   clarifies the goat domestication scenario already proposed by
   archaeological evidence. All of the mitochondrial DNA haplogroups found
   in current domestic goats have also been found in the bezoar. The
   geographic distribution of these haplogroups in the wild ancestor
   allowed the localization of the main domestication centers. We found no
   haplotype that could have been domesticated in the eastern half of the
   Iranian Plateau, nor further to the east. A signature of population
   expansion in bezoars of the C haplogroup suggests an early domestication
   center on the Central Iranian Plateau (Yazd and Kerman Provinces) and in
   the Southern Zagros (Fars Province), possibly corresponding to the
   management of wild flocks. However, the contribution of this center to
   the current domestic goat population is rather low (1.4\%). We also
   found a second domestication center covering a large area in Eastern
   Anatolia, and possibly in Northern and Central Zagros. This last
   domestication center is the likely origin of almost all domestic goats
   today. This finding is consistent with archaeological data identifying
   Eastern Anatolia as an important domestication center.},

Abstract = {A recent study in 2019-2020 assessed the productivity, the quality of
   fatty and essential oils, and the mineral composition of eight nigella
   genotypes at the Federal State Budget Scientific Institution (FSBSI),
   Research Institute of Agriculture of Crimea, Simferopol, Russia. Of the
   eight genotypes, two cultivars originated from Crimea, Russia (Nigella
   sativa cv. `Krymchanka,' and Nigella damascena cv. `Yalita'), and one
   each from six European-Asian countries, i.e., Dagestan, Uzbekistan, and
   Sweden (Nigella sativa), Pakistan and India (Nigella indica), and
   Belgium (Nigella damascena). The Russian nigella genotypes served as
   control. Genotypes from three European-Asian countries (Sweden,
   Pakistan, and Dagestan) distinguished from the rest by their highest
   seed productivity, i.e., 1.0-1.6 g plant-1, which was 1.7-2.7 times
   higher than the control cultivar `Krymchanka.' The seed productivity of
   the genotype N. damascena cv. `Yalita' control was 1.5 times greater
   than the nigella genotype from Belgium. The N. indica produced the
   highest fatty oil content (29.9\%), which exceeded two other species,
   i.e., N. sativa and N. damascena by 16\%-22\%. Fatty oils of nigella
   also contained essential oils of 0.5\% for N. sativa and 1.2\% for N.
   damascena. The essential oil of N. sativa contained dominant components,
   such as, p-cymene (53.5\%) and thymoquinone (19.2\%), while N. damascena
   contained p-cymol (82.2\%) and other principal components. The
   identified samples with the maximum accumulation of fatty and essential
   oils, and macro and microelements can be used to treat and replenish the
   deficient elements in the human body. Nigella genotype samples exhibited
   high accumulation of microelements, viz., potassium, calcium, manganese,
   iron, copper, zinc, and molybdenum in the leaves and seeds.},

Abstract = {The phylogenetic positions of 39 Aegilops tauschii plants with different
   gliadin haplotypes and collected from two habitats in Dagestan, where
   the species is highly variable, were defined on an intraspecies
   phylogenetic tree based on DNA sequences of the nuclear gene Got2. Among
   Ae. tauschii subsp. tauschii plants, in addition to its single major
   phylogenetic lineage, a plant from a rare relict lineage previously
   noted very far from Dagestan in Iran, Turkmenistan and Pakistan, was
   found. Among Ae. tauschii subsp. strangulata plant representatives, two
   (out of five) major lineages of this subspecies and one relict lineage
   were found (all these were previously found in Dagestan). Knowing that
   Ae. tauschii has a high migration capacity, it was very surprising not
   to find plants representing the other three common major lineages of
   subsp. strangulata, two of which are known to inhabit Azerbaijan near
   Dagestan. Additionally, the locations of three Ae. tauschii accessions
   from the Yellow River Basin (two of which are known to be native to this
   region) were defined on the phylogenetic tree. They were found to belong
   to the major lineage of Ae. tauschii subsp. tauschii. The data obtained
   indicate that none of the several major lineages of subsp. strangulata,
   which successfully coexist, have ever been able to occupy the whole
   subspecies distribution area throughout the species evolutionary
   history. In contrast, in subsp. tauschii, each (or most) of several
   lineages that are now relicts, occupied the whole subsp. tauschii range
   for some period of time in the past.},

Abstract = {The ecology of the species was studied in Daghestan throughout all the
   seasons from 1986 to 1993.  Two main factors determine the number and
   distribution of turs:  1) inaccessibility of habitats (rocky and steep
   mountain slopes), the area of main ranges:  2) feeding conditions and
   first of all the area and productivity of winter pastures.  The highest
   population density of turs was observed on the spurs of large
   mountain-masses, which are more than 7-10 km long and more than 4000 m
   high.  The population density of turs varies in different regions from
   1,8 to 7,3 animals per 100 ha., their total number is about 20 000
   animals which is more than 2-2,5 times as high as noted in former papers
   concerning this species.
   The study revealed, that in the areas, which are not intensively used
   for agriculture, the average winter density of the populations in
   different localities of the area is stable (31 to 35 animals per 100
   ha.).  Probably, it is determined by carrying capacity of winter
   pastures and reflects the maximum number of a population.  In areas,
   where the degree of exploitation of winter pastures by cattle exceed
   80\%, the population density of turs reduces and does not exceed 11.5 to
   15.3 animals per 100 ha.  That can be attributed to the consumption of
   some part of vegetation by sheep.},

Abstract = {The annual legume crop clusterbean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub.)
   is a promising crop for cultivation in the south of Russia. In 2018,
   phytosanitary examinations of clusterbean fields (13 collection
   accessions) were conducted in five VIR branches (Krasnodar Territory,
   Dagestan, Astrakhan and Volgograd Regions). At all points, several types
   of leaf spots were observed on clusterbean leaves and symptoms of plant
   damage by fungi of the genus Alternaria Nees prevailed. Using
   microbiological methods and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) of the
   nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer two (ITS2), the species
   composition of micromycetes was identified. It was found that the
   micromycetes Alternaria spp. in different ecological and geographical
   conditions of the south of Russia cause two main types of leaf spots:
   the typical (beige and brown round spots, usually accompanied by
   concentric zonality) and brown spot (small brown bulging merging spots).
   Overwhelmingly the damage to leaf tissues is caused by the fungus A.
   tenuissima (Nees \& T. Nees : Fr.) Wiltshire. A quite numerous
   accompanying mycoflora (first of all, fungi of the genus Fusarium Link)
   was also detected. A. cyamopsidis Rangaswami \& A.V. Rao, one of the
   most harmful guar pathogens in the countries where the main acreage is
   located (India, Pakistan, USA), was not found on clusterbean fields in
   Russia. The accessions of clusterbean differ in degree of damage by A.
   tenuissima that causes Alternaria leaf blight. Differential interaction
   of parasite and plant host was revealed. Therefore, to prevent
   epiphytotics, varieties protected by non-identical resistance genes
   should be grown. At all VIR branches, accessions k-52568 (Argentina) and
   k-52569 (Pakistan) were weakly damaged by Alternaria leaf blight, and
   some accessions were resistant only in the environmental conditions of
   one or two experimental stations. The accessions studied were
   heterogeneous in pathogen resistance, which allows selecting
   disease-resistant lines from most of the collection accessions. Thus, in
   various VIR branches, plants without symptoms of disease were selected
   from accessions k-52571, k-52573 and k-52580, and seeds were collected
   to create new donors of disease resistance.},

Abstract = {The priority task for domestic agribusiness is to ensure conditions for
   stable economic growth. To meet international standards, Russian farmers
   need to maximize production efficiency and increase the level of
   profitability of agricultural products. Positive economic dynamics in
   the agricultural sector can be achieved by attracting both extensive and
   intensive factors of production. Having an ambiguous agro-industrial
   complex, there is a serious differentiation of the food market sectors
   in terms of sufficiency, and on the other hand, there is a decrease in
   demand due to declining population real incomes. To assess the level of
   import substitution, a cluster analysis was carried out. The taxonomy of
   regional statistics divided the regions into two groups. Cluster No. 1
   (Moscow Region, Tatarstan, Krasnodar and Altai Territories,
   Bashkortostan, Voronezh Region, etc.) demonstrates serious success in
   organizing the dairy industry from the perspective of import
   substitution, since its own production satisfies not only domestic
   needs, but also ensures the export flow. Cluster No. 2 (Chelyabinsk,
   Bryansk, Omsk regions, Udmurtia, the Republic of Dagestan, etc.) is
   polar to cluster No. 1 in terms of technical and economic indicators
   characterizing the development of the dairy industry. To improve the
   sustainability of the industry and intensify the processes of import
   substitution, it is necessary to improve the system of state regulation.
   The set of necessary measures includes: physical and economic
   accessibility of loans, review of the regulatory framework in the field
   of modernization of the rural economy, stimulating the efficiency of
   agricultural production and using the green box tools (in particular,
   the food card program).

Abstract = {An American sociologist reports results of survey research conducted in
   1993 among Muslims in the five Islamic Autonomous Republics of Russia (N
   = 4,955). The data demonstrate that the strength of Islam as both a
   religious and social institution varied regionally despite the shared
   experience of Soviet anti-religious policies. Muslims in Chechnya and
   Dagestan were much more likely to report that they actively practiced
   Islam than Muslims living in Kabardino-Balkariya, Tatarstan, and
   Bashkortostan. Moroever, religious practice was high among
   non-traditional groups of Chechentsy and Avartsy. The young, the urban
   migrants, the highly educated, and men reported high levels of active
   worship. In Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, and Kabardino-Balkariya, in
   contrast, active religiosity was primarily confined to old, rural women
   with low levels of education. These differences, it is argued, are
   linked to the Sufi Islam tradition present in Chechnya and Dagestan but
   absent in the other Muslim autonomous republics.},

Abstract = {The phylogeography of the European wild boar was mainly determined by
   postglacial recolonization patterns from Mediterranean refugia after the
   last ice age. Here we present the first analysis of SNP polymorphism
   within the complete mtDNA genome of West Russian (n = 8), European (n =
   64), and North African (n = 5) wild boar. Our analyses provided evidence
   of unique lineages in the East-Caucasian (Dagestan) region and in
   Central Italy. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that these lineages are
   basal to the other European mtDNA sequences. We also show close
   connection between the Western Siberian and Eastern European
   populations. Also, the North African samples were clustered with the
   Iberian population. Phylogenetic trees and migration modeling revealed a
   high proximity of Dagestan sequences to those of Central Italy and
   suggested possible gene flow between Western Asia and Southern Europe
   which was not directly related to Northern and Central European
   lineages. Our results support the presence of old maternal lineages in
   two Southern glacial refugia (i.e., Caucasus and the Italian peninsula),
   as a legacy of an ancient wave of colonization of Southern Europe from
   an Eastern origin.},

Abstract = {The supplementary description of the oribatid mite species Discoppia
   (Cylindroppia) cylindrica (Perez-inigo, 1965) (Oribatida, Oppiidae) is
   presented, based on materials collected from deep layers of coastal
   sandy soils in the Republic of Dagestan, eastern Caucasus. The
   morphology of exobothridial seta, gnathosoma and ovipositor, and the
   identification of leg setae and solenidia are given for the first time
   for this species. The revised generic diagnosis, identification key,
   distribution, and habitats of all known representatives of Discoppia
   Balogh, 1983 are presented. Some taxonomic nuances within Discoppia are
   discussed, resulting in the following proposals: Oppia bifidus Bayoumi
   and Al-Khalifa, 1985 is a junior synonym of D. (C.) cylindrica; Oppia
   agricola Fujikawa, 1982 is not synonym of D. (C.) cylindrica and
   transferred to the genus Microppia Balogh, 1983; Oppia tenuis Hammer,
   1958 is not representative of Discoppia; Discoppia (Cylindroppia)
   rostroincisa Subias and Rodriguez, 1986 n. stat. (instead of the
   existing subspecies status). Together with D. (C.) cylindrica, in the
   same samples, two rare Oppiidae species were found: Oxyoppia
   (Oxyoppiella) minuscula Hugo-Coetzee, Lotfollahi, Abbasi-Kalo and
   Movahedzade, 1917 (known only from the open habitats in Iran) is first
   recorded in Russia; Graptoppia (Stenoppia) boucheri Ermilov and Frolov,
   2021 (known from passalid beetles collected in Ghana and Gabon, West
   Africa) is first found in the Palaearctic. Both findings in Dagestan are
   among the northernmost records of their semicosmopolitan subgenera.},

Title = {Haematological profile and genetic variation of brown Caucasian dairy

Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {Aim. The rational use of North Caucasus forage lands, a large part of
   which is located in the mountains, is one of the important tasks in
   addressing the issue of improving the efficiency of cattle breeding.
   This appears quite challenging, as the mechanisms of adaptation of farm
   animals, in particular cattle, to the environmental and climatic
   peculiarities of a certain region have not been sufficiently explored.
   Since hematopoietic function of blood is the basis of organism's vital
   functions and genetic polymorphism is the measure of its adaptability,
   the present study is aimed at examining haematological profile and the
   degree of genetic variation in the Brown Caucasian cattle.
   Materials and Methods. Haematological, genetic and statistical methods
   of analysis were used to examine the haematological profile and genetic
   structure of genes GH, PIT-1, PRL in Brown Caucasian dairy cattle, bred
   in different ecological and climatic zones of Dagestan.
   Conclusion. This was the first time that hematopoietic function was
   studied in the context of genetic variation in Brown Caucasian dairy
   cattle bred in the foothills (100-200 m above sea level) and mountains
   (650-1,250 m above sea level). The information obtained gives an idea of
   and an answer to the question about the role of haematological profile
   and the degree of genetic variation in the development of adaptive and
   compensatory mechanisms to specific environmental conditions. The use of
   haematological, molecular and genetic methods allows the further
   exploration of the adaptation traits of Brown Caucasian dairy cattle for
   their further improvement.},

Abstract = {Genetic variation between different populations of Puccinia triticina
   from Russia and Kazakhstan was evaluated, based on 18 simple sequence
   repeat (SSR) markers. Seventeen collections of P. triticina (181
   single-uredinial isolates, in total) obtained from 15 different host
   species belonging to Aegilops and Triticum were included in the study.
   All single-uredinial isolates were obtained from naturally infected
   plants in experimental fields in Dagestan (Caucasus region of Russia),
   Novosibirsk (West Siberian region of Russia) and Shortandy (Northern
   Kazakhstan). Regional differentiation of P. triticina SSR genotypes was
   detected. Collections from host plants with the same ploidy and/or
   genetically similar background were genetically similar. Collections
   from the hexaploid species in Dagestan were highly similar to those from
   common wheat. Collections from tetraploid species T. aethiopiNum, T.
   turaniNum, T. dicoccum (genome BD'A(u)A(u)) from Dagestan were
   moderately different from the collections originated from the hexaploid
   species. Puccinia triticina from Ae. crassa ((DDMM)-D-c-M-c) collected
   in Dagestan was genetically similar to populations from common wheat and
   other hexaploid species. Collections from Ae. tauschii (2n = 2x = 14)
   were significantly different from those obtained from tetraploid (2n =
   4x =28) and hexaploid (2n = 6x =42) host species collected on the
   experimental field in Dagestan. SSR genotypes of P. triticina isolates
   from T. durum in Kazakhstan were highly dissimilar to those sampled from
   all other hosts. A low association was established between the SSR
   genotypes of P. triticina identified in the present study and the
   virulence phenotypes for the same set of collections, as observed in a
   previous study.},

Abstract = {On the basis of the allelic composition of ten microsatellite loci and
   mtDNA sequences, we studied the genetic structure of the common hamster
   populations that inhabit cities and suburban settlements in Ciscaucasia.
   It was shown that, in urbanized territories, the hamster population is
   divided into separated groups, the genetic differences between which are
   high and not related to the distance between them. On the outskirts of
   cities adjacent to undeveloped or green areas and further in rural
   areas, the degree of isolation of neighboring hamster settlements
   decreases, and the level of genetic differences between them begins to
   correspond to the distance separating the settlements. In the course of
   work, this species was first registered within the territory of the
   easternmost part of Ciscaucasia, in the Republic of Dagestan.},

Abstract = {Virulence of 347 single-uredinial isolates of Puccinia triticina from 16
   species of Aegilops and Triticum grown in experimental fields with
   natural inoculum in Dagestan (Caucasus region of Russia) and Novosibirsk
   (West Siberian region of Russia) and in an artificially inoculated field
   in Shortandy (Northern Kazakhstan) was analyzed with 20 near-isogenic
   wheat differential lines. All isolates were avirulent to Lr9, Lr19, and
   Lr24, and virulent to Lr11, Lr14a, Lr17a, and Lr30 genes. The P.
   triticina isolates varied for virulence on resistance genes Lr1, Lr2a,
   Lr2b, Lr2N, Lr3a, Lr3bg, Lr3ka, Lr14b, Lr15, Lr16, Lr18, Lr20, and Lr26.
   Forty virulence phenotypes of P. triticina were identified, of which
   seven virulence phenotypes were shared by at least two hosts. The
   virulence analysis revealed differences between P. triticina from
   diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid species of wheat. Collections from the
   hexaploid species in Dagestan were more similar to those from common
   wheat. Isolates from tetraploid species were less virulent. Asian
   isolates (Novosibirsk and Northern Kazakhstan) originating from common
   wheat and T. dicoccum were more virulent than those from Caucasus.},

   Material and Methods. On the surface of crusty solonchak there is formed
   a layer of silt-sand fractions with seeds of wild phytocenoses which
   move/(sic) over the surface of the soil under the influence of
   atmospheric processes with the utilization of wood. material protruding
   above the soil surface to 0.2 m. Analyses, surveys and observations were
   carried out of the key parts (for investigation - under the aeolian
   layer) of the crusty solonchak transformed through the dynamics of
   humidity, lowering of soil moisture (SC), granulometric composition,
   chemistry and level of soil salinity, as well as determination of the
   species composition of the phytocenoses and the accumulation of

   Cca,s] is changed to that of regraded solonchak C-K(W) {[}W-ael - AJ,s -
   BCA,s - Cca,s]. The granulometric composition of the soil is improved
   and a productive phytocenosis is formed.
   Conclusion. The positive transformation of crusty solonchak to regraded
   contributes to the reduction of soil deflation and of aerial
   contamination by dust particle fractions, the lowering of carbon
   emissions from the soil and of the natural greenhouse effect, the
   increase of the utilization coefficient of photosynthetically active
   radiation (PAR) and the prevention of excessive overheating of the soil
   and atmosphere.},

Abstract = {The geothermal resources of Russia have been studied since 1956. Three
   versions of the country's geothermal maps and estimation of geothermal
   field reserves with a total design yield of 218 m(3)/s have been
   developed. The largest reserves are available in Kamchatka krai, the
   Kuril Islands, the Republic of Dagestan, Krasnodar krai, Stavropol krai,
   and the Republic of Adygea. Steam-hydrothermal fields are located mainly
   in Kamchatka and the Kunashir Island (the Kuril Islands). In Russia, a
   total of 26 geothermal fields were in operation in 2019, including 11
   fields in Kamchatka, four in Dagestan, and 11 in Krasnodar krai,
   Stavropol krai, and the Republic of Adygea. In 2019, 743 500 t of
   geothermal steam (without the Mutnovsky and Verkhne-Mutnovsky fields)
   and 20.2 million m(3) of geothermal water were produced, including 13.9
   million m(3) in Kamchatka, 4.3 million m(3), in Dagestan, and 2.0
   million m(3) in Krasnodar krai, Stavropol krai, and the Republic of
   Adygea. In 2019, 161 geothermal wells were in operation in Russia,
   including 84 wells in Kamchatka, 42 in Dagestan, and 35 in Krasnodar
   krai, Stavropol krai, and the Republic of Adygea. The Russian geothermal
   electric power facilities with a total capacity equal to 83.9 MW, which
   produced 428 million kW h of electric energy in 2019, are reviewed. The
   main technical characteristics and basic thermal cycle circuits of the
   Pauzhetka and Mutnovsky geothermal power plants (GeoPPs) are considered,
   and the problems connected with their operation and the prospects for
   their future development are pointed out. In 2019, 23 heat distribution
   stations (HDS) and central heat-supply stations (CHSS) with the total
   thermal power capacity equal to 82.5 MW and the thermal energy output
   equal to 282 000 (MW h)/year supplied geothermal heat for regions in
   Russia. The total length of geothermal heat networks in the two-pipe
   equivalent was equal to 172 km. The specific features relating to the
   operation of HDSs and CHSSs are pointed out, and prospects for the
   future development of geothermal heat supply are determined.},

Abstract = {In modern conditions, against the background of the negative impact in
   the form of sanctions on the Russian economy the retaliatory measures on
   the part of the Russian authorities contributed to a significant
   decrease in the number of food imports to the Russian market. In this
   regard, the problem of ensuring the food security of the country is
   significantly actualized. Consequently, a justified assessment of the
   role and place of certain types of agricultural products in the
   development of food markets is required. Since the beginning of the
   2000s, Russia has been gradually recovering the sphere of turkey meat
   production. This type of poultry product has high dietary and taste
   properties, is a source of high-quality proteins, and contains a large
   number of useful elements and vitamins. In this regard, the purpose of
   this paper is to assess the role and importance of turkey meat
   production in the total volume of poultry meat production as a whole and
   to develop, based on the data analysis, directions for the further
   progressive development of this sphere of agricultural production.
   The paper provides a comparative analysis of the indicators of the
   Russian turkey meat market with similar indicators of the poultry meat
   market as a whole, identifies the reasons for such a significant lag in
   the turkey breeding sector from the poultry industry in the country as a
   whole, and outlines the main directions for overcoming the critical
   situation in the sub-industry.},

Abstract = {Aim. The work is aimed at exploring the molecular and genetic properties
   of avian paramyxovirus 4 (APMV-4) isolated from the mallard duck.
   Material and Methods. In 2018, as a part of an influenza A virus
   surveillance programme, biological samples were collected from wild
   birds on Lake Adzhi (Papas) in the Republic of Dagestan. The isolation
   of virus strains from biological samples was performed using 10-day-old
   special pathogen free chicken eggs. The primary detection of
   hemagglutinating agents in the fluid of the allantoic cavity was carried
   out via hemagglutination assay. The presence of RNA of the influenza A
   virus was determined using Real Time PCR. Then, for samples negative in
   PCR for the influenza A virus, the complete genome DNA sequences were
   established using NGS sequencing. It was determined that the APMV-4
   strain obtained belonged to intraspecific genetic lines was determined
   using phylogenetic analysis.
   Results. APMV 4 strain was isolated for the first time in the Western
   Caspian region. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome and gene F
   showed that the APMV-4/mallard/Dagestan/52d/2018 strain belongs to the
   Eurasian Glade of subgenotypes. Analysis of amino add substitutions
   showed that the cleavage site of the fusion protein is monobasic which
   is characteristic of lentogenic strains.
   Conclusion. During the surveillance program for influenza A viruses in
   autumn 2018, the APMV 4 strain was isolated from the mallard duck.
   Analysis revealed that the APMV-4 strain was closely phylogenetically
   related to strains isolated from two wild and one domestic duck from
   China. This suggests an interconnection between the bird populations in
   China and the Western Caspian region within the West Asian-East African
   migration route.},

Abstract = {Among 371 oat accessions from the world collection of the Vavilov
   Institute of Plant Genetic Resources (VIR) mostly represented by the
   landraces from Asia (Maritime Territory of Russian Federation, Mongolia,
   China, Japan, North Korea, India, Iran, Afghanistan, and Bhutan) ninety
   five were heterogeneous for resistance to the North Caucasus populations
   of the greenbug (Schizaphis graminum Rondani). Damage ratings of
   resistance in 47 accessions were high, low level of resistance was
   identified in 48 genotypes. Higher frequency of greenbug resistant
   accessions (60.5\%) was found among landraces from Mongolia. Lines with
   high expression of the resistance were selected from seven landraces
   with wide range of damage ratings. North Caucasus populations of S.
   graminum from Krasnodar area and Dagestan significantly differ by the
   frequencies of virulence to host plant. Seven virulence phenotypes
   differentially interacting with oat genotypes were found in the
   Krasnodar population and 10 phenotypes were revealed in the Dagestan
   population. Results of the experiments with the greenbug test clones
   revealed that all the lines selected from the accessions VIR-2490,
   VIR-2539, VIR-4074, VIR-12213, VIR-12214 (Mongolia), VIR-6688 (India)
   and VIR-13624 (North Korea) are protected by diverse alleles of
   resistance genes which differ from the earlier identified gene Grb3.
   These lines are supposed to have aphid resistance genes nonidentical to
   the Grb1 and Grb2. The accessions VIR-6688, VIR-4074 and VIR-12214
   possess high resistance to Krasnodar and Dagestan greenbug populations
   and the accession VIR-13624 is protected by the most effective gene
   (genes) of resistance to the both populations from North Caucasus.},

Title = {On the Functional Role of Land Cadastre Elements under Conditions of
   Arid Soil Formation},
Journal = {ARID ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {116-125},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The functions that determine physicochemical and biological processes
   that contribute to the development of soil formation and elements of the
   Land Registry are considered. Modern trends in soil development are
   characterized by intensification of use and reduction of their
   functioning areas. The mechanism of formation of objects of
   anthropogenic soil formation and elements of the Land Cadastre has been
   studied in the Terek-Kuma Lowland, which is one of the main regions of
   the Caspian Lowland, which is prone to desertification and aridization.
   The hierarchical system of objects of the Land Cadastre according to the
   scale of the functions performed is differentiated at the level of
   gradations of global, federal, and constituent entities of the Russian
   Federation and municipalities. The analysis of the elements of the Land
   Cadastre and their role in a multi-sectoral plan was carried out using
   the ecological-biosphere concept of soil formation, the fundamental
   basis of which boils down to the differentiation of objects into two
   groups: the sphere of objects of human economic activities, as a result
   of which land biomass is created and oxygen is produced using carbon
   dioxide for photosynthesis and the sphere of industries, housing
   construction, and transport communications, which consume biogenic
   energy and organic matter. In addition to the selected groups, the
   sphere of geological deposits is included. The technogenic cover,
   consisting of elements simultaneously performing the functions of
   cadastral registration and processes of anthropogenic soil formation,
   has been determined starting from detailed survey scales (1 : 100 and 1
   : 1000). The cadastral burden at the most highly detailed scales of
   research creates a minimal burden. At the first stage of cadastral
   registration, the assessment is carried out covering individual areas
   and fields of crop rotation and the elements of the minimum size used
   when performing field work. At the second stage, larger objects are
   allocated as production units (crop rotation lands, team plots, and
   pasture rotation fields). The variety of objects of the Land Cadastre
   and their combination with the technosphere create a special structure
   of categories of biotic and abiotic natures that are ubiquitous on the
   earth's surface. The emergence of a land cadastre and its assessment are
   determined by the production functions necessary to create favorable
   conditions for obtaining economic products. Cadastral objects act here
   as a factor of anthropogenic soil formation. Their influence is
   manifested in changes in soil properties: the temperature of the surface
   layers of the earth, the content of humus, the dry residue of easily
   soluble salts, volumetric weight, and water permeability. The cadastral
   content of the technogenic soil cover resulting from the influence of
   the anthropogenic factor is in a state of dynamic development due to two
   factors: the market economy and the direction of the arid type of soil
   formation.},

Pages = {168-174},
Abstract = {Aim. To test the effectiveness and environmental friendliness of a new
   method of biothermal treatment of bird litter and disinfectant -
   Penoks-2 - in relation to bird coccidia oocysts. Material and Methods. A
   test of biothermal disinfection of bedding manure and disinfestation of
   premises for rearing young laying hens (6000 birds), was carried out in
   the Mugutdinova farm of the Buynaksky district of the Republic of
   Dagestan. The detection of coccidia oocysts was carried out according to
   the method of Void and Darling, Methods for the Laboratory Diagnosis of
   Avian Coccidiosis{''}. The quality of the disinfestation using Penox-2
   solutions was controlled by examining swabs and scrapings taken from the
   experimental and control surfaces of the premises in accordance with the
   Rules for Disinfection and Disinfestation of Objects of State Veterinary
   Supervision. The study of biothermal processes in the litter manure was
   carried out every 5 days with temperature measurement of piles, while
   taking samples of the litter for detecting the presence of coccidia
   oocysts. Results. The studies conducted established that the most
   environmentally safe method of disinfecting premises is biothermal where
   the population of replacement laying hens is kept. The temperature in
   piles 1.5 and 2.0 m high and 2-2.5 m wide reached 65-75 \& DEG;C on the
   20-25th day, which ensures the destruction of coccidia oocysts.
   Production tests have shown that solutions of the new Penox-2 agent
   destroy coccidia oocysts in the external environment after irrigation of
   room surfaces with a content of 3.0\% chloramine B through a single
   application at the rate of 0.5 l/m2 and 3 hours exposure. Conclusion.
   Tests of a new method of biothermal treatment of litter manure and
   disinfestation with solutions of Penox-2 showed high efficiency and
   environmental safety in the destruction of coccidia oocysts.},

Abstract = {The article presents the results of experimental studies of a potato
   digger with standard (control) and bar undermining working bodies
   (experience). A relationship has been established between the speed of
   the harvester and the loss (number of seedlings) of potato tubers for
   various harvesting options. The aggregate composition of the soil is
   justified when using the above potato digger. It was found that an
   increase in the speed of movement of the potato digger by 1 km/h leads
   to an increase in losses of potato tubers in the control variant by 2.7
   pcs/m. In the experimental version, it leads to a decrease in losses of
   potato tubers by 2.0 pcs/m. Besides, in the control variant, an increase
   in the speed of movement from 1.8 to 3.4 km/h led to an increase in
   losses of potato tubers by an average of 4.7 pcs/m, when in the
   experimental variant the casualties were 4 pcs/m. However, with the
   pilot version, the speed increase was from 2.6 to 3.4 km/h, the losses
   decreased by an average of 1.0 pcs/m, with a parallel rise in potato
   digger productivity.},

Abstract = {A collection of Puccinia triticina isolates was characterized for
   polymorphism of microsatellite loci and estimated for their
   differentiation by geographic origin. The collection included 20
   isolates from the Ural region, 31 from West Siberia, 53 from Central
   Europe, 32 from the Northwest region, 32 from the Volga region, and 40
   from the North Caucasus (24 from Dagestan and 16 from Krasnodar and
   Stavropol). The studied isolates were represented by 65 virulence
   phenotypes. In the polymorphism analysis of 18 microsatellite loci, 69
   genotypes were determined. The index values of genetic distances (Fst,
   Rst, KBc) between populations for microsatellite loci indicated
   differentiation of P. triticina isolates according to geographical
   origin, and they were clustered into three groups: (1) Asian, (2)
   European, and (3) North Caucasian. The North Caucasian isolates from
   Krasnodar and Stavropol regions were closer in similarity to European
   isolates than the Dagestan ones. Current analysis confirmed the
   assumption made earlier on the basis of the virulence analysis about the
   existence of several geographic fungi populations in Russia.},

Abstract = {Interspecific relationship among wild beets in section Corollinae was
   analyzed. Isozyme allele composition supports the concept of three basic
   species consisting of two diploid species, Beta lomatogona and Beta
   macrorhiza and the tetraploid species, Beta corolliflora. The polyploid
   and apomictic species referred to as Beta trigyna and Beta intermedia
   were found as hybrids. Based on isozyme and RAPD results, B.
   corolliflora was also found more related to B. macrorhiza than to B.
   lomatogona. From the phylogenetic trees constructed from isozyme data,
   B. corolliflora and B. macrorhiza seem to be the end members of the
   evolutionary line. Analysis of genetic diversity showed that B.
   corolliflora was more polymorphic and heterozygous than B. lomatogona
   and B. macrorhiza. Differences between B. macrorhiza accessions from
   Turkey and Dagestan were found.},

Abstract = {Human health depends largely on the quality of food consumed. Recently,
   there is a shortage in the supply of adequate food products. Wild
   berries are a natural source of biologically active substances so
   necessary for normal functioning of our body. Therefore, developing wild
   berries-based food products is a topical area of research. Objects of
   research are wild berries - briar, barberry, buckthorn, hawthorn, and
   viburnum, which are widespread in the territory of Dagestan. These
   berries are highly popular and widely used in traditional medicine.
   However, these berries are not involved in the industrial processing of
   the republic. Based on the studies of the chemical-technological
   characteristics, we can conclude that wild berries are generally
   recognized as leaders in the content of the most important nutritional
   bioactive, naturally-generated components, and therefore represent an
   exceptional value for a healthy diet and, of course, are a valuable
   source of raw materials for high-quality food products.},

Abstract = {Nowadays there is much tension in the Russian modern vine growing
   industry around the issue of enhancing the range of grape varieties,
   which is aimed at production of highly adaptive grape plants and
   sustainable production of competitive grape varieties in the unstable
   stressing weather conditions of the moderate continental climate in the
   south of Russia. In this view, we believe it important to carry out
   research into the origin, generation and preservation of genetic
   resources so that they can be involved in the selection process and
   reach most important objectives of the national economy. The role of a
   variety and ampelographic collections becomes more important. The Anapa
   ampelographic collection (http://azosviv.info/category/
   osnovnye\_razdely/anapskaya\_ampelograficheskaya\_kollekciya) is
   Russia's largest gene pool depository of grape varieties brought from
   various countries of Europe, Asia and America, and Russia's regions as
   well. It contains 4921 grape varieties, including Vitis vinifera L.
   (2975), V. amurensis Rupr. (40), V. labrusca L. (50), the interspecies
   varieties V. vinifera L. x V. amurensis Rupr. (210), V. vinifera L. x V.
   labrusca L. (168), blended interspecies hybrids V. vinifera Lx hybrids
   SV (220), V. vinifera L. x V. amurensis Rupr. x hybrids SV (70), and
   other samples. We carry out extensive research into collection varieties
   for their production and selection. We select varieties and forms
   showing good agronomic characters in productivity, quality of grapes and
   wine products, winter hardiness, drought resistance, and resistance to
   pests. We have identified, preserved and now use in selection, as
   sources of good agronomic characters of resistance to low temperatures
   in winter, such varieties as Riesling of the Rhine, Rkatsiteli, Aligote,
   Riesling of Italy, Traminer Pink, Pinot Noir, Rara Neagra, Cabernet
   Sauvignon, Coarna Neagra, Pinot Gris, Gamay Freaux, Saperavi, Muscat
   Ottonel, Madeleine Angevine, Cabernet Franc, Khikhvi, Pearl of Csaba,
   Chardonnay, Krasnostop of Anapa, Dostoiniy, Krasnostop AZOS, etc.The
   collection has given birth to twenty seven varieties and elite forms, of
   which twelve varieties have been sent to the State Committee for the
   Testing of New Varieties of Agricultural Plants (Pluto, Muzhestvenniy
   (Courageous), Gordiy (Proud), Maran, Varvarovsky, Harmony, Progress,
   Gorniy (Mountaneous), Saturn, Dimitry, Vladimir, Kurchansky). We carry
   out a molecular genetic testing of the accumulated gene pool and
   DNA-classification of varieties. We have studied the microsatellite
   polymorphism in the genotypes of autochthonous grape varieties of the
   Don River and the Republic of Dagestan. We are performing the
   DNA-classification of varieties selected by the North Caucasian Regional
   Research Institute of Horticulture and Viticulture (Krasnodar), which is
   advantageous for the identification of pure varieties in planting
   material and vineyards and specifying of the parent forms of grape
   varieties, as well as when any disputes arise as to the variety

Title = {Genetic relationships and structured diversity of <i>Lactuca

Abstract = {We studied the genetic relationships of Lactuca georgica samples
   originating in Armenia and the Russian Federation with samples
   representing four other predominantly self-pollinating wild Lactuca
   species (L. serriola, L. aculeata, L. saligna, and L. virosa)
   originating in various countries, as well as with samples representing
   cultivated lettuce, L. sativa by using 48 TRAP markers. We also
   visualized their genetic diversity and structure. The present study is
   likely the first molecular phylogenetic evaluation of a detailed
   screening of L. georgica germplasm. Data analysis of the three major
   wild species in this study, L. georgica (134 samples), L. virosa (57
   samples), and L. serriola (40 samples) showed that allele frequencies of
   all 47 polymorphic loci varied significantly among the species. A total
   of 11, 9, and 10 alleles were unique to L. georgica, L. serriola, and L.
   virosa, respectively; 71\% of TRAP marker diversity was between species.
   The Neighbor-Joining tree clearly clustered the whole set of 238 samples
   according to their taxonomic determination. It also reflects the gene
   diversity as well as the genetic distance values among samples
   representing the between and within variance of the various species. The
   L. georgica samples clustered most distantly from the L. sativa samples.
   The interspecies comparisons between samples belonging to L. georgica
   with those belonging to L. sativa displayed a high distance, lower only
   from the interspecies comparisons between samples belonging to L. virosa
   (in the tertiary gene pool of cultivated lettuce) with those belonging
   to L. sativa. Thus, additional molecular data with more hybridization
   experiments are necessary to reconsider if L. georgica is indeed a
   constituent of the primary gene pool of cultivated lettuce. The L.
   georgica samples were divided into two sub-clusters, with samples
   collected in southeast and central Armenia grouping together while all
   those collected in the north and Dagestan grouped together.},

Title = {SNP-Based Genotyping Provides Insight Into the West Asian Origin of
   Russian Local Goats},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN GENETICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Specific local environmental and sociocultural conditions have led to
   the creation of various goat populations in Russia. National goat
   diversity includes breeds that have been selected for down and mohair
   production traits as well as versatile local breeds for which
   pastoralism is the main management system. Effective preservation and
   breeding programs for local goat breeds are missing due to the lack of
   DNA-based data. In this work, we analyzed the genetic diversity and
   population structure of Russian local goats, including Altai Mountain,
   Altai White Downy, Dagestan Downy, Dagestan Local, Karachaev, Orenburg,
   and Soviet Mohair goats, which were genotyped with the Illumina Goat
   SNP50 BeadChip. In addition, we addressed genetic relationships between
   local and global goat populations obtained from the AdaptMap project.
   Russian goats showed a high level of genetic diversity. Although a
   decrease in historical effective population sizes was revealed, the
   recent effective population sizes estimated for three generations ago
   were larger than 100 in all studied populations. The mean runs of
   homozygosity (ROH) lengths ranged from 79.42 to 183.94 Mb, and the
   average ROH number varied from 18 to 41. Short ROH segments (<2 Mb) were
   predominant in all breeds, while the longest ROH class (>16 Mb) was the
   least frequent. Principal component analysis, Neighbor-Net graph, and
   Admixture clustering revealed several patterns in Russian local goats.
   First, a separation of the Karachaev breed from other populations was
   observed. Moreover, genetic connections between the Orenburg and Altai
   Mountain breeds were suggested and the Dagestan breeds were found to be
   admixed with the Soviet Mohair breed. Neighbor-Net analysis and
   clustering of local and global breeds demonstrated the close genetic
   relations between Russian local and Turkish breeds that probably
   resulted from past admixture events through postdomestication routes.
   Our findings contribute to the understanding of the genetic
   relationships of goats originating in West Asia and Eurasia and may be
   used to design breeding programs for local goats to ensure their
   effective conservation and proper management.},

Title = {Rhizobia Isolated from the Relict Legume <i>Vavilovia formosa</i>

Abstract = {Twenty-two rhizobia strains isolated from three distinct populations
   (North Ossetia, Dagestan, and Armenia) of a relict legume Vavilovia
   formosa were analysed to determine their position within Rhizobium
   leguminosarum biovar viciae (Rlv). These bacteria are described as
   symbionts of four plant genera Pisum, Vicia, Lathyrus, and Lens from the
   Fabeae tribe, of which Vavilovia is considered to be closest to its last
   common ancestor (LCA). In contrast to biovar viciae, bacteria from
   Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii (Rh) inoculate plants from the
   Trifolieae tribe. Comparison of house-keeping (hkg: 16S rRNA, glnII, glt
   A, and dnaK) and symbiotic (sym: nodA, nodC, nodD, and nifH) genes of
   the symbionts of V. formosa with those of other Rlv and Rlt strains
   reveals a significant group separation, which was most pronounced for
   sym genes. A remarkable feature of the strains isolated from V. formosa
   was the presence of the nodX gene, which was commonly found in Rlv
   strains isolated from Afghanistan pea genotypes. Tube testing of
   different strains on nine plant species, including all genera from the
   Fabeae tribe, demonstrated that the strains from V. formosa nodulated
   the same cross inoculation group as the other Rlv strains. Comparison of
   nucleotide similarity in sym genes suggested that their diversification
   within sym-biotypes of Rlv was elicited by host plants. Contrariwise,
   that of hkg genes could be caused by either local adaptation to soil
   niches or by genetic drift. Long-term ecological isolation, genetic
   separation, and the ancestral position of V. formosa suggested that
   symbionts of V. formosa could be responsible for preserving ancestral
   genotypes of the Rlv biovar.},

Abstract = {The results of comparative brucellosis diagnostic studies of blood sera
   from cattle at farms with different epizo-otic situations, performed in
   2021 in the laboratory of the Caspian Zonal Research Veterinary
   Institute - a branch of the Dages-tan Agriculture Science Centre, are
   presented in the paper. The diagnostic efficiency of the indirect
   hemagglutination test (IHA) was studied in comparison with enzyme
   immunoassay (ELISA), agglutination test (RA), complement fixation test
   (CFR), rose-bengal test (RBP) and immunodiffusion reaction with O-PS
   antigen (RID with O-PS antigen). The specificity of these sero-logical
   tests was confirmed by the negative results of studies of 40 samples of
   blood serum of non-vaccinated against brucellosis animals at a
   brucellosis-safe farm. The sensitivity of the tested diagnostic tools
   was determined using 46 blood serum samples from cows immunized with the
   B. abortus 82 vaccine at a brucellosis-prone farm. According to the
   results obtained, in particu-lar, according to a significant percentage
   of animals positively reacting to brucellosis in RID with O-PS antigen
   and high titers of RNHA, RA and RSK, it can be stated that the infection
   in the herd proceeds in an acute form. Thus, positive results were
   obtained in RNGA in the study of 18 (39.1\%), ELISA (LLC NPF
   ``Sibbiotest{''}) - 29 (63 \%), in RSK - 18 (39.1 \%), in RA - 15 (32.6
   \%), RBP - 15 (32.6 \%) and RID with O-PS antigen - 7 (15.2 \%) blood
   serum samples. The conducted studies have shown that RNHA is one of the
   most sensitive tests, which makes it possible to detect a high
   percentage of animals with brucellosis at a brucellosis-prone farm
   (39.1\% of those studied) in the early stages after infection and
   surpasses the results of most other sero-logical methods. The results of
   comparative serological studies of blood serum samples of cattle in
   RNHA, IEA, RSK, RA, RBP and RID with O-PS confirmed the specificity of
   the tests and the high sensitivity of RNHA with brucellosis erythrocyte

Abstract = {The relevance of the study of mycoses is increasing due to their
   widespread distribution. Field experiments were carried out on sites in
   the region with short daylight hours (Dagestan) and long daylight hours
   (Volgograd). Fungal diseases were investigated on crops with short
   daylight hours: cucumber, pepper, and cotton according to the methods
   generally accepted in phytopathology. The species composition of
   aboriginal and exotic infections was revealed. Each culture under
   conditions of long daylight hours is characterized by damage by 4-5
   species of fungi. The manifestation of exotic infections is observed at
   the beginning of the growing season at the seedling stage. The role of
   the introduction of short-day plants to the northern regions in the
   spread of exotic species of pathogenic fungi is shown. The species
   composition of fungi on crops in the study areas was found to be
   identical. They belong to different biological groups, but saprotrophs,
   biotrophs and hemibiotrophs predominate. It was found that Fusarium
   lolii (Wm.G. Sm.) Sacc and Rhizoctonia solani Kuehn (on cotton) and
   Verticillium dahliae Kleb and Rhizoctonia solani J.G. moved to new areas
   together with seeds. Kuhn (on pepper). These species are capable of
   causing epiphytotics at the beginning of the growing season with a low
   natural infectious background. The accumulation of native species of
   infection in the lands adjacent to the fields during the cultivation
   period leads to the appearance of epiphytoties in the second half of the
   growing season. First of all, the assimilation apparatus, flowers,
   ovaries and fruits are affected.},

Abstract = {Recently, the importance of studying the biodiversity of the Vitaceae
   Juss family. increases markedly, while new data appear on the gene pool
   of cultivated and wild-growing grapes Vitis vinifera L. Modern methods
   of analyzing the polymorphism of populations of grape plants, both
   wild-growing and cultural, are actively used. According to the
   literature, a number of studies have been conducted in the Russian
   Federation to study native varieties and wild forms of grapes in the
   Crimea, Dagestan, along the banks of the Don and other regions, but
   there is very little information about Kuban wild and ancient forms of
   grapes. The article presents the results of a study of wild forms of the
   genus Vitis L., growing in places of ancient human settlements on the
   territory of the Utrish State Nature Reserve of the Krasnodar Territory.
   For the first time, ampelographically and genetically samples of
   isolated populations of wild grapes growing on the territory of the
   Utrish State Nature Reserve have been studied and described. Several
   habitats of wild grapes, presumably belonging to the Vitis vinifera ssp
   species, have been studied. Silvestris Gmel. or its variants var. Tipica
   Negr. - typically wild forest grapes. A detailed description of
   phytocenoses in which the studied plant forms grow is carried out.
   Ecological and geographical characteristics of their habitats are given.
   Samples were taken for further genetic analysis. DNA-marker analysis of
   plant genotypes by microsatellite loci VVMD27, VVMD5, VS2, VrZAG79
   recommended for genotyping of grapes was performed. It was shown that
   some of the samples are polymorphic to each other, while others are
   genetically close. When analyzing genotypes, rare alleles were detected
   for the analyzed SSR loci.},

Title = {Historical and areal Aspects of Natural Resource Terminology in East
   Caucasian languages},
Journal = {IRAN AND THE CAUCASUS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {17},

Pages = {295-320},
Abstract = {The present paper discusses the historical background of selected terms
   in the world of East Caucasian languages that are related to the domain
   of metallurgy (copper, iron, tin, plumb, gold, and silver) augmented by
   terms for `coal' and `salt'. A closer inspection of these terms shows
   that none of them can be reconstructed for Proto-East Caucasian. Rather,
   we have to deal either with terms that have been coined in the
   intermediate protolanguages (Nakh, Avar-Andian, Tsezian, Lezgian, Lak,
   Dargwa, and Khinalug) or with more or less recent loans stemming mainly
   from the Iranian and Turkic languages. The absence of reconstructable
   terms for the items under review suggests that the speakers of the East
   Caucasian proto-language had not been involved expressively in
   metallurgic traditions (as opposed to farming traditions). Tentatively,
   these speakers can thus be associated with the early farming culture
   within the complex of the Kuro-Araxes Culture. Only after the
   proto-language disintegrated due to the migration of most of its
   speakers in the Dagestan and the regions of Chechnya, some societies
   related to these intermediate proto-languages must have been involved
   more expressively in metallurgic traditions. The more recent loans, e.g.
   for copper, gold, and silver, stemming from Iranian (Persian) and Turkic
   (Kumyk and Azeri) illustrate a shift in conceptualising these objects:
   They were now interpreted as artifacts (rather than as natural
   resources) that were associated with the cultures of the dominant
   `Oriental' societies. The paper can be seen as a preliminary study
   concerning the areal distribution of lexical patterns in the Eastern
   Caucasus from a historical perspective.},

Abstract = {Yellow (stripe) rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici
   (Pst), is a major disease of common wheat worldwide. Disease epidemics
   in Russia have been frequent and destructive, mostly in the North
   Caucasus. However, over the last 5 years, the significance of Pst has
   markedly increased in other Russian regions. Therefore, the Pst
   virulence diversity was investigated in Triticum aestivum in six
   geographically distant regions of the European (North Caucasus,
   North-West, Low Volga, Central Black Earth region, and Volga-Vyatka) and
   Asian (West Siberia) parts of Russia, with strongly different climates,
   environmental conditions, and growing wheat genotypes. Seventy-nine
   virulence pathotypes among 117 isolates were identified using the 12
   Avocet Yr gene lines (Yr1, Yr5, Yr6, Yr7, Yr8, Yr9, Yr10, Yr15, Yr17,
   Yr24, Yr27, and YrSp) and eight supplemental wheat differentials (Heines
   VII, Vilmorin 23, Hybrid 46, Strubes Dickkopf, Carstens V, Suwon
   92/Omar, Nord Desprez, and Heines Peko). Only four pathotypes occurred
   in two or more regions. High variability was detected within Pst
   populations from Dagestan, Central, North-West, and West Siberia that
   postulated to form an intrapopulation subdivision of each of them into
   several subgroups. Most regional virulence groups of pathotypes were
   closely related, except for several small subgroups of pathotypes from
   West Siberia, Dagestan, North-West, and Central European regions. All
   Pst isolates were avirulent in lines with Yr5, Yr10, Yr15, and Yr24
   genes. Virulence to Yr17 was detected for several isolates of two
   pathotypes, one each from the North-West and Low Volga regions.
   Variation in virulence frequency was observed in other differential
   lines.},

Abstract = {The need for effective nutrient management is crucial for optimizing
   wheat production and increasing the plant's ability to tolerate
   different environmental stresses. In this study, we assessed the
   influence of new-generation PGRs and foliar topdressing nitrogen
   fertilizer and their interactive effects on wheat yield and quality
   parameters of grain and flour. A three-year field experiment was
   conducted on the dark chestnut soil of the Rostov region. We estimated
   the effect of foliar topdressing liquid nitrogen fertilizer on
   consumption rates of N32 (N32), N64 (N32 + N32), and N96 (N32 + N32 +
   N32), as well as new-generation plant growth regulators (PGRs), namely,
   Zirkon, Silk, and Albit, on the productivity and grain quality of winter
   wheat Tarasovskaya 70. The results of the experiments indicate that the
   highest average grain yield over three years was 5.34 t/ha(-1) with the
   application of N96 (N32 + N32 + N32) and Albit PGR. In 2020, due to
   favorable weather conditions, the greatest grain yield was attained at
   6.27 t/ha(-1) for N96 (N32 + N32 + N32) and Albit PGR. The highest grain
   quality with the greatest gluten content >28\% was obtained when N96
   (N32 + N32 + N32) and PGRs were applied. According to the results, using
   N96 (N32 + N32 + N32) and PGRs made it possible to obtain ``valuable{''}
   grain in terms of quality, which is suitable for the production of
   premium flour. The beneficial interactive effects of N application rates
   and PGRs on winter wheat yield and quality parameters are worthy of
   further investigation.},

Abstract = {In 2007-2008, the barley net blotch agent Pyrenophora teres was found to
   infect spring wheat in northwestern Russia, causing symptoms similar to
   wheat tan spot caused by P. tritici-repentis. The frequency of
   occurrence of P. teres on spring wheat cultivars was 12-29\%. P. teres
   isolates were more virulent to some wheat cultivars than P.
   tritici-repentis ones. P. teres was not found on wheat in the south of
   Russia (Krasnodar krai, Dagestan).},

   material. These tomatoes, grown in the mountains, on soils with high
   salinity, contain high amounts of valuable components and have long term
   preservation. For the extraction of valuable components from dried
   tomato pomace, the CO2 extraction method is applied. The technological
   and environmental feasibility of graded tomato drying in the atmosphere
   of an inert gas and in a solar drier is evaluated; the scheme of dried
   tomatoes production is improved; a system for tomato pomace drying is
   developed; a scheme of tomato powder production from pulp, skin and
   seeds is developed. The combined method of tomato pomace drying involves
   the simultaneous use of electromagnetic field of low and ultra-high
   frequency and blowing hot nitrogen on the product surface. Conducting
   the drying process in the atmosphere of nitrogen intensifies the process
   of removing moisture from tomatoes. The expediency of using tomato
   powder as an enriching additive is proved. Based on the study of the
   chemical composition of the tomato powder made from the Dagestan
   varieties, and on the organoleptic evaluation and physicochemical
   analysis of finished products, we prove the best degree of
   recoverability of tomato powder in the production of reconstituted juice
   and tomato beverages.},

Abstract = {In Islam, saint worship (awliya) is a problem for both the Muslim
   scholars (ulema) and academics specialized in Mid-Eastern studies. Its
   characteristics during the post-Soviet era are identified in the attempt
   to review modern approaches to studying the late 20th-century Islamic
   revival in the northern Caucasus. Data collected among the Rutul, a
   small group dwelling in the mountains of southern Dagestan, shed light
   on the meaning of Muslim religiosity at the microsocial level of a
   kolkhoz or rural clan. Focus is placed: on the types of shrines in the
   Samur Valley, their architecture and rites; on legends about the sheikhs
   buried there; and on the social functions of these shrines and their
   relation to Sufism. Muslim practices among the Rutul during the
   post-Soviet era are hybrid. They are not remnants from a pre-Islamic
   past; nor are they related to the rites of Sufi brotherhoods. They are
   evidence of the overall transformation of local Muslim society due to
   modern secular reforms. To better delimit the post-Soviet patchwork of
   religions, we must abandon once and for all simplistic contrasts between
   traditional and modern Islam, between an Islam of the Book and popular
   Islam.},

Abstract = {The biodiversity of the Vitaceae Juss family is studied with more
   interest than before, but still not fully according to the current
   scientific literature. For example, indigenous varieties and wild forms
   of grapes are known in the Crimea, Dagestan, along the banks of the Don
   and in other regions, but there is practically no data about wild and
   autochthonic grapes in the Kuban. This work presents new data about wild
   grapes studied in the Krasnodar region in the forests of the ``Red
   forest{''} reserve. The ecological and geographical conditions of their
   growth are studied in detail. The description of plant community where
   the studied plant forms grow is conducted. Isolated populations of wild
   grapes, presumably belonging to the species of Vitis vinifera ssp.
   silvestris Gmel. or its varieties - var. Tipica Negr. (typical wild
   forest grapes) were ampelographically studied. Samples were taken for
   further genetic analysis to identify the origin of these forms and
   identify promising donors of resistance to various environmental
   stressors for use in the breeding process.},

Abstract = {Soil Sinorhizobium phage AP-16-3, a strain phylogenetically close to
   Rhizobium phage 16-3, was isolated in a mountainous region of Dagestan,
   belonging to the origin of cultivated plants in the Caucasus, according
   to Vavilov N.I. The genome of phage AP-16-3 is 61 kbp in size and
   contains 62 ORFs, of which 42 ORFs have homologues in the genome of
   Rhizobium phage 16-3, which was studied in the 1960s-1980s. A search for
   Rhizobium phage 16-3-related sequences was performed in the genomes of
   modern strains of root nodule bacteria belonging to different species,
   genera, and families. A total of 43 prophages of interest were
   identified out of 437 prophages found in the genomes of 42 strains, of
   which 31 belonged to Sinorhizobium meliloti species. However, almost all
   of the mentioned prophages contained single ORFs, and only two prophages
   contained 51 and 39 ORFs homologous to phages related to 16-3. These
   prophages were detected in S. meliloti NV1.1.1 and Rh. leguminosarum
   OyaliB strains belonging to different genera; however, the similarity
   level of these two prophages did not exceed 14.7\%. Analysis of the
   orphan genes in these prophages showed that they encoded predominantly
   virion structural elements, but also enzymes and an extensive group of
   hypothetical proteins belonging to the L, S, and E regions of viral
   genes of phage 16-3. The data obtained indicate that temperate phages
   related to 16-3 had high infectivity against nodule bacteria and
   participated in intragenomic recombination events involving other
   phages, and in horizontal gene transfer between rhizobia of different
   genera. According to the data obtained, it is assumed that the
   repetitive lysogenic cycle of temperate bacteriophages promotes the
   dissolution of the phage genetic material in the host bacterial genome,
   and radical updating of phage and host bacterial genomes takes place.},

Abstract = {This article describes the condition and spread of one of the most
   mobile forms of pastoralism, transhumance, as well as factors and
   transition pathways that have taken place in the pastoral systems of the
   North Caucasus. The weakening of centralization and control over local
   economies, as well as the cessation of subsidies to collective and state
   farms in the 1990s, led to the destruction of state-regulated
   transhumance. At the same time, traditional institutions and local forms
   of social organization, such as ethnic groups, tribal alliances, and
   family associations, are playing an important role. This study is based
   on mapping of pasture use, analysis of statistical data, and interviews
   with shepherds, municipal authority representatives, and government
   officials from regional agricultural departments. It describes the
   factors promoting or limiting transhumance in 4 regions (Dagestan,
   Chechnya, North Ossetia-Alania, and Karachay-Cherkessia), including
   ethnicity, land tenure, the status of privatization of agricultural
   land, and centralization of power. Leading actors and institutions in 3
   periods, pre-Revolutionary, Soviet, and post-Soviet, are considered,
   with a more detailed analysis of the last period right up to present
   times. The role of resettlement of people from the mountains to the
   plains in the Soviet period, which contributed to the development of
   transhumance in the modern period, is emphasized. institutional hybrids
   are discussed, including formal state and informal (traditional and new)
   rules to regulate the use of pastures during the transition from the
   Soviet central planning system to market relations.},

Abstract = {Locusts and grasshoppers are dangerous polyphagous pests of agricultural
   crops. In the present paper, results of screening of Acridoidea
   populations in the South-Western Russia for microsporidia infections
   including locusts Locusta migratoria, Dociostaurus maroccanus, and
   Calliptamus italicus and grasshoppers Chorthippus loratus, Oedipoda
   caerulescens, and Acrida bicolor, are presented. Microsporidia
   prevalence rates were estimated using light microscopy of fresh smears.
   Out of 179 specimens of L. migratoria sampled between 2002 and 2019 in
   Krasnodar Territory, Astrakhan and Rostov Regions, none was infected
   with microsporidia. Similarly, 95 specimens of D. marrocanus from
   Krasnodar Territory (2017) and Dagestan Republic (2009) were also
   negative for microsporidia. Meanwhile, one positive case was detected
   for C. italicus corresponding to 0.5 \% for the total amount of 192
   exemplars collected from 2002 to 2019 in Krasnodar Territory, Astrakhan
   and Rostov Regions. As for grasshoppers, all Ch. loratus samplings in
   Krasnodar Territory in 2017-2019 were infected at the prevalence rates
   of 2.2-15 \%, though no infection was found in 40 specimens in Crimea in
   2019. In 56 individuals of O. caerulescens collected from Rostov Region
   and Krasnodar Territory, the microsporidia prevalence rate was 1.8 \%.
   Among 96 specimens of A. bicolor, none was infected. In total, the
   microsporidia prevalence rates were higher in grasshoppers as compared
   to locusts, the difference being statistically significant at p<0.01.},

Abstract = {Galactomannan (gum), a water-soluble polysaccharide, is widely used as a
   gelling agent in liquids, including in the oil and gas industry for
   hydraulic fracturing. The most effective source of this valuable plant
   material is seeds of guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub.), a legume
   crop new for Russia. Although in recent years progress has been made in
   the selection of guar varieties adapted to the conditions of the Russian
   Federation, the question of the most appropriate region for the
   cultivation of this crop remains open. The purpose of the study was to
   investigate how a region and technology of guar cultivation can affect
   the main indicators of the final target product: the content and
   viscosity of guar gum extracted from the seeds of various guar
   genotypes. To understand this, ecogeographical tests of 13 guar
   accessions from the VIR collection were conducted at the experimental
   stations of the Vavilov Institute (VIR), where climatic conditions
   correspond to the temperature requirements of the crop. To compare the
   properties of gum extracted from the seeds of various genotypes, a
   fast-tracked laboratory method was suggested allowing gum extracts to be
   obtained for assessing their viscosity. The method allows fast screening
   of the breeding material and selecting guar genotypes with beneficial
   properties of guar gum which are in demand by the oil industry. Applying
   the fast laboratory method for assessing the properties of gum in seeds
   of 13 guar varieties showed that the content and viscosity of gum of the
   same variety vary greatly depending on growing conditions. The same set
   of 13 guar accessions was grown in 2018 at the Volgograd, Astrakhan,
   Dagestan and Kuban VIR experimental stations. As a result, the maximum
   viscosity values were obtained for the seeds reproduced at the Astrakhan
   region, where the guar was grown on irrigated lands. On the other hand,
   the maximum gum content in the seeds of all accessions was recorded when
   they were grown in the Volgograd region. The results showed that the
   guar gum extracted from seeds of guar plants grown in the Russian
   Federation can be used as a gelling agent in the processes of
   intensification of oil production by the method of hydraulic fracturing.
   This experience is new to the Russian Federation.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the negative problems of financial policies of
   municipalities caused by external, rather than financial reasons. It
   analyses field researches held in 2009-2012 in the Republic of Dagestan,
   Altai Krai, Tverskaya oblast, Ivanovskaya oblast, Kirovskaya oblast,
   Kostramskaya oblast, Smolenskaya oblast. They all belong to the group of
   endowments. There were 21 municipalities that participated in the
   research: 5 city circuits, 7 municipal districts, 8 rural settlements
   and 1 urban settlement.
   The research singled out the main non-financial reasons for ineffective
   management of finances at the municipal level such as: (1) peculiarities
   of the developed system of real relationships between the state and
   municipal authorities; (2) negative impact of personal features of the
   head of the municipality on the quality of management; (3) municipal
   bureaucrats lack any stimulus to increase the revenue base.
   Recommendations: state bodies of power should heed the opinion and
   support initiatives of local authorities to increase financial security.
   To stimulate municipalities for increasing their own revenues, it is
   necessary that state programs for the promotion of more successful
   municipalities into regions that have no such programs should be
   adopted. Such programs must stimulate developing of the depressive
   municipalities without decreasing stimuli to develop in the successful
   municipalities. Besides, it necessary regions should develop cooperation
   and exchange positive experience in this field.},

Abstract = {The intensification of pasture degradation in the southern part of
   European Russia, which is caused by unfavorable hydrothermal conditions
   and unregulated livestock numbers, requires the development of
   approaches to assess the capacity of forage lands using Earth remote
   sensing methods. The spectral reflectance properties of vegetation are
   determined by its taxonomic, structural, phenological, biophysical, and
   biochemical characteristics. However, the patterns of how these
   parameters affect the spectral response are region-specific and heavily
   influenced by soil cover. Therefore, it is essential to expand the
   regional scope of studies on the spectral reflectance properties of
   various vegetation types. This research is devoted to determining the
   spectral reflectance properties of natural zonal pastures in southern
   European Russia, based on geobotanical investigations and field
   spectrometry using the PSR-1100f instrument within the 320-1100 nm
   range. Groundwork was carried out in May (the period of maximum green
   mass of vegetation) 2020-2022 in the territories of natural zonal
   pastures in Astrakhan and Volgograd oblasts, Stavropol krai, and the
   Republics of Dagestan and Kalmykia. Significant differences were found
   between feather grasses, semishrubs, and annuals in the visible and
   near-ultraviolet spectral regions. Changes in the projective cover,
   under other equal conditions, have the most significant impact on
   spectral properties in the 660-670 nm range, which is consistent with
   the results of other researchers. Vegetation indices were identified
   that are best suited for determining projective cover and above-ground
   biomass of pastures with various dominant species. Further research will
   enable transitioning from point measurements of spectral reflectance and
   structural vegetation characteristics to satellite data with different
   spatial resolutions.},

Abstract = {According to FAOSTAT, in 2018-2019 rice was planted in 118 countries on
   an area of 167 million hectares, the annual grain production in the
   world is about 782 million tons. Rice is the most popular cereal in the
   diet of the Russian consumer. Rice growing is a small but rather
   important branch of the agro-industrial complex of the Russian
   Federation. The main rice producers in the world are China (over 214
   million tons), India (over 172 million tons), Indonesia (83 million
   tons), Bangladesh (56 million tons), Vietnam (44 million tons), Thailand
   (32 million tons) and Myanmar (25 million tons). In the Russian
   Federation, rice is grown in three federal districts, in nine subjects:
   in the Southern Federal District - the Republic of Adygea, Kalmykia,
   Krasnodar, Astrakhan and Rostov Regions; North Caucasian Federal
   District - Republics of Dagestan and Chechen; Far Eastern Federal
   District - Primorsky Territory and the Jewish Autonomous Region.
   Scientific support of the rice-growing industry in the Russian
   Federation is carried out by the Federal Scientific Rice Centre.},

Title = {The Allelic Diversity of the Gibberellin Signaling Pathway Genes in

Abstract = {Gibberellin-insensitive reduced height genes are widely spread in modern
   wheat varieties, making them resistant to lodging under conditions of
   intensive farming. However, the limited diversity of these genes present
   in wheat germplasm can limit the adaptability of newly created cultivars
   to the changing climate. The diversity of the gibberellin signaling
   pathway genes involved in plant height control-Reduced height 1
   (Rht-D1), Gibberellin-insensitive dwarf 1 (Gid1-D) and
   Gibberellin-insensitive dwarf 2 (Gid2-D)-was studied in the diploid wild
   goatgrass Aegilops tauschii Coss., one of the ancestral species of the
   bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and the donor of its D subgenome,
   using high-throughput sequencing. The examination of 24 Ae. tauschii
   accessions of different geographical origins revealed a large number of
   new alleles (haplotypes) not found in bread wheat varieties. Some of the
   detected polymorphisms lead to changes in the amino acid sequence of
   proteins. Four isoforms (amino acid sequence variants) were found for
   the RHT-D1 protein, and two isoforms-for the GID1 and GID2 proteins,
   each. An analysis of the co-occurrence frequencies of various isoforms
   of the three proteins showed that their combinations were not random in
   Ae. tauschii, which may indicate the functional significance of their
   differences. New alleles of the Rht-D1, Gid1-D, and Gid2-D genes are
   promising for introgression into bread wheat and studying their effect
   on plant height and adaptability.},

Title = {Influence of skin folding types on the efficiency of feed in Groznensky
   sheep},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LIVESTOCK SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {255-261},
Abstract = {In sheep husbandry, as in other branches of animal husbandry, emphasis
   is often given on study of the consumption and use of feed by sheep. The
   present study was aimed to determine the level of transformation of feed
   into products (feed conversion) by young animals of various types of
   skin folds economics of feed with respect to increase in live weight and
   wool. The study was carried out in the period from 2016 to 2019, on
   sheep of the Grozny breed, in the Limited Liability Company (LLC)
   Plemzvod ``Chervlennye Buruny{''} of the Nogai region of the Republic of
   Dagestan, Russia. It was found that young animals with an insufficient
   supply of skin spend on 1 kg of live weight gain -6.80 - 9.68 ECU
   (energy feed unit (ECU) is taken 10 MJ of exchange energy), and peers
   with a satisfactory and increased supply of skin, respectively 8.00 -
   10.91 and 9.77-11.87 ECU. Average daily gain in live weight in young
   animals with insufficient skin supply is 1.9-29.6\% higher than in peers
   of other types. The growth of wool in pure fiber on an area of 100 cm(2)
   is higher in young animals with a satisfactory supply of skin, which
   surpassed their peers with an insufficient supply of skin - by 2.2 - 8.0
   and with an increased supply of skin by 2.0 7.8\%. Differentiated
   determination of feed consumption per 1 kilogram of live weight gain and
   pure wool gain showed that animals with a satisfactory skin supply for

Abstract = {Research into the phylogenetic relationships of lumpy skin disease virus
   (LSDV) strains was long overlooked, partially due to its original
   restricted distribution to sub-Saharan Africa. However, recent
   incursions into northern latitudes, and a rapid spread causing major
   economic losses worldwide, have intensified additional research on the
   disease and the causative virus. This study delineates the phylogeny of
   LSDV in the context of full genome sequences of strains recovered in the
   field, as well as strains highly passaged in cell culture. We sequenced
   the oldest known field strain to date (isolate LSDV/Haden/RSA/1954
   {[}South Africa] recovered from an outbreak in 1954), a recent field
   isolate (LSDV/280-KZN/RSA/2018 {[}South Africa] sequenced directly from
   blood during an outbreak in 2018) and strain LSDV/Russia/Dagestan-75 (a
   high-passaged cell culture strain derived from the field strain,
   LSDV/Russia/Dagestan/2015 {[}Russia]). Sequence analysis placed the
   field strain LSDV/Haden/RSA/1954 in the same cluster (cluster 1.1) with
   attenuated Neethling-type commercial vaccine viruses, with eight SNP
   differences, discrediting the previously held hypothesis that cluster
   1.1 vaccine strains were derived from cluster 1.2 field viruses via the
   process of attenuation between them. In contrast, the recent
   LSDV/280-KZN/RSA/2018 isolate grouped with other recent field isolates
   in cluster 1.2, providing evidence that cluster 1.1 strains were
   displaced by cluster 1.2 strains in South Africa. Based on the field
   isolates between 1954 and 2018, the substitution rate of 7.4 x 10(-6)
   substitutions/site/year was established, with mutations occurring in
   either synonymous sites or intergenic regions. This is the first
   evolutionary metric recorded for LSDV. Comparing the genome sequences of
   high-passage strains of LSDV showed that propagation in vitro without
   animal host selective pressure generates mainly non-synonymous SNPs in
   virus-replication genes. These results improve our understanding of LSDV
   evolution and demonstrate that the population dynamics of circulating
   isolates is not constant, with LSDV associated with different genetic
   clusters dominating the landscape during specific periods in time.},

Abstract = {Two geographers report on the current challenges facing the inhabitants
   of the Caucasus mountains on the borders of Russia and its southern
   neighbors, Georgia and Azerbaijan. The authors discuss the impacts of
   new post-Soviet borders and controls as well as unresolved conflicts in
   Nagorno-Karabakh, Chechnya, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and the Prigorodnyy
   district of North Ossetia, which have disrupted traditional ways of life
   and forced the peoples of the mountains to migrate or adjust their
   economic activities. Based on extensive field work in 2005-2006, and in
   the 1990s, they detect some signs of improvement in the new privatized
   environment after the difficult years of transition. However, the weak
   infrastructure of the region, combined with the high costs associated
   with development and modernization of peripheral locations, suggest that
   resettlement from the high mountains to the cities on the plains and
   piedmont is likely to continue.},

Abstract = {Triticum aestivum L. (bread wheat) is the most important cereal crop in
   world grain production, including in the territory of the Russian
   Federation. One of the most important factors influencing the yield and
   quality of wheat grain is the affection of plants with leaf rust
   (Puccinia triticina Erikss.). To broaden the set of sources for
   effective rust resistance, spring bread wheat samples from N.I. Vavilov
   All-Russian Institute of Plant Genetic Resources (VIR) were monitored
   for adult resistance to the disease under natural infections for many
   decades at three distant locations of the Russian Federation: the
   Dagestan Experimental Station (DES) of VIR (10,549 accessions),
   Yekaterinino Experimental Station (YES) (4384 accessions), and Pushkin
   Experimental Field (PEF) (7704 accessions). Information on the disease
   development at these three stations is presented at least for 51 last
   years. As a result of disease development evaluation under natural
   epiphytotic conditions for not less than 3 years, 293 (15 landraces, 127
   breeding lines, and 151 commercial varieties), 118 (1 landrace, 38
   breeding lines, and 79 commercial varieties), and 127 (10 landraces, 48
   breeding lines, and 69 commercial varieties) samples were classified as
   resistant to leaf rust at DES, YES, and PEF, respectively. Among samples
   from the State Register of Breeding Achievements in Russia, 15, 13, and
   8 spring wheat varieties were resistant to leaf rust at DES, YES, and
   PEF, respectively. Juvenile resistance was estimated under laboratory
   conditions after seedling inoculation with a complex population of P.
   triticina: 73 highly resistant varieties and breeding lines were
   identified; all landraces, including those classified as resistant in
   the fields, were susceptible to disease at the seedling stage. A total
   of 26 wheat accessions were identified to be resistant to leaf rust at
   two to three locations; 14 of them possess adult resistance, and 12
   samples have seedling resistance. According to results of PCR
   amplification with primers specific to markers of effective genes for
   leaf rust resistance, 6 accessions have gene Lr9, 1 sample is protected
   by Lr19, and 1 sample possesses gene Lr24. Wheat samples identified as
   possessing effective seedling or adult resistance could be of interest
   for breeding in some regions of the Russian Federation and other
   countries.},

Abstract = {Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) is a high-value oilseed crop with
   growing importance in numerous countries around the globe. This study
   was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the basic tillage technique
   and various seeding rates on the yield, oil accumulation and
   photosynthetic potential of different safflower cultivars (Kamyshinskiy
   73, Zavolzhskiy 1 and Alexandrite) in the Volgograd Region of Southern
   Russia. Three field experiments were conducted at the research farm of
   Volgograd Agricultural State University during 2018-2020. The treatments
   were arranged as split plots based on a randomized complete block design
   with three blocks. Tillage treatments (basic tillage as the control
   (moldboard PN-4-35, depth 20-22 cm), chisel ploughing (OCHO 5-40, depth
   35-37 cm) and disc ploughing (BDM-4, depth 12-14 cm)) were assigned to
   the main plots, and seeding rates (200, 300 and 400 m(2)/m(2)) were
   allocated to the subplots. The maximum leaf area, with a value of 26.35
   m(2)/m(2) and the greatest photosynthetic potential of 1489 thousand
   m(2) x day ha(-1), was obtained in Alexandrite with the interaction of
   deep chisel ploughing and a seeding rate of 400 thousand seeds ha(-1).
   The highest dry biomass was also achieved in Alexandrite, with a value
   of 3.24 t ha(-1), with the interaction of deep chisel ploughing and a
   seeding rate of 400 thousand seeds ha(-1). The highest yield (1.84 t
   ha(-1)) and oil accumulation (28.75\%) were recorded for Alexandrite
   with the interaction of deep chisel ploughing and a seeding rate of 300
   and 400 thousand seeds ha(-1) respectively. Overall, in terms of tillage
   treatments, the safflower productivity was highest when chisel tillage
   was performed, and the lowest yield was observed with the small disc
   ploughing practice. The yield of Alexandrite cultivar was noted to be
   4.4-4.8\% higher than that of the Zavolzhsky cultivar and 9.2-10.8\%
   higher than that of the Kamyshinsky 73 cultivar.},

Abstract = {This paper is an attempt to consider historical processes in Eastern
   European desert-steppe zone in the Bronze Age in the context of
   correlation between the economic pattern and the changing environment.
   Geographically the study is confined to the southern part of the
   Volgograd oblast, almost the entire Republic of Kalmykia, the eastern
   districts of the Stavropol Region and the northeastern districts of the
   Republic of Daghestan, and chronologically to the late Middle Bronze
   Age, the post-Catacomb period and the early Late Bronze Age. Up to now
   palaeoecological reconstructions have not been taking into account the
   influence of the variation of annual precipitation on the economy of
   early societies. A conjugate analysis of the evolution of the Bronze Age
   cultures and the dynamics of the environment enabled us to ascertain
   that the survival of early pastoralists in the desert-steppe zone
   depended primarily on climate conditions of the cold period, i.e. on the
   amount and forms of winter precipitation. The increasing climate aridity
   in the desert-steppe zone around the turn of the 2nd millennium BC was
   due to the intensification of the winter anticyclone having led to the
   contraction of the volume of precipitation in the cold year period. In
   these conditions cold dry weather with a thin snow layer or its total
   lack particularly suitable for winter grazing sets in. It was against
   such a climatic background that the Lola culture based on small cattle,
   sheep and goat keeping evolved. The reverse process, i.e. the decrease
   of the winter anticyclone in the 18th-17th centuries BC, led to the
   increase of precipitation, frequent snowstorms, ice-covered grass, the
   formation of ice crust and the thickening of the snow layer. In such
   conditions the number of days suitable for grazing decreases and
   consequently the livestock is subject to weakening and sicknesses which
   may bring about its total loss. It seems likely that this was the reason
   of a gradual deterioration of post-Catacomb cultures of the
   desert-steppe zone. On the whole, the well-known gaps in the desert
   steppe exploitation in the Bronze Age correlated with the optimization
   of natural conditions while the period of the increasing climate aridity
   saw the heyday of early pastoralism.},

Title = {Assessment of Caspian Seal By-Catch in an Illegal Fishery Using an
   Interview-Based Approach},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {The Caspian seal (Pusa caspica) has declined by more than 90\% since
   1900 and is listed as endangered by IUCN. We made the first quantitative
   assessment of Caspian seal by-catch mortality in fisheries in the north
   Caspian Sea by conducting semi-structured interviews in fishing
   communities along the coasts of Russia (Kalmykia, Dagestan), Kazakhstan
   and Turkmenistan. We recorded a documented minimum by-catch of 1,215
   seals in the survey sample, for the 2008-2009 fishing season, 93\% of
   which occurred in illegal sturgeon fisheries. Due to the illegal nature
   of the fishery, accurately quantifying total fishing effort is
   problematic and the survey sample could reflect less than 10\% of
   poaching activity in the north Caspian Sea. Therefore total annual
   by-catch may be significantly greater than the minimum documented by the
   survey. The presence of high by-catch rates was supported independently
   by evidence of net entanglement from seal carcasses, during a mass
   stranding on the Kazakh coast in May 2009, where 30 of 312 carcasses
   were entangled in large mesh sturgeon net remnants. The documented
   minimum by-catch may account for 5 to 19\% of annual pup production.
   Sturgeon poaching therefore not only represents a serious threat to
   Caspian sturgeon populations, but may also be having broader impacts on
   the Caspian Sea ecosystem by contributing to a decline in one of the
   ecosystem's key predators. This study demonstrates the utility of
   interview-based approaches in providing rapid assessments of by-catch in
   illegal small-scale fisheries, which are not amenable to study by other
   methods.},

Abstract = {This study is based on the material of darkling beetles (Tenebrionidae)
   collected from different localities of Turkey between 1966 and 2020 and
   deposited in Biodiversity Science Museum, Atat??rk University (Erzurum,
   Turkey). In total, 80 species and subspecies of the family Tenebrionidae
   were listed. The following five species are recorded for Turkey for the
   first ropatroides hirtulus (Baudi di Selve, 1876). In addition, new
   localities have been indicated for many species and subspecies, which
   have already been reported from Turkey. The new synonymy is proposed:
   Blaps tibialis Reiche \& Saulcy, 1857 = Blaps ecaudata Seidlitz, 1893,
   syn. nov. The invasive population of the Mediterranean species Euboeus
   mimonti Boieldieu, 1865 was found in Erzurum but the species has not
   naturalised in Eastern Anatolia.},

Abstract = {A new species of canestriniid mite belonging to the genus Ciprusenia
   Haitlinger, 2022 is described based on the morphological characteristics
   of male, female, tritonymph, protonymph and larva life stages. It is the
   sixth species of this genus and was collected from Blaps bushirensis
   Kaszab, 1959 (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) on the surface soil of Sahlak
   Cave (Fars, Iran). The genus Ciprusenia is a new record for the
   Astigmata fauna Iran and the host species is a new host record for the
   family Canestriniidae. In this study, descriptions are carried out in
   detailed line drawings and scanning electron microscopic images. The

Abstract = {White clover populations collected from the Caucasus region and eastern
   Turkey were compared with seven white clover cultivars in a moist,
   lowland, highly fertile environment. The Caucasus collection came from
   15 sites below 1000 m and 19 sites above 1000 m; all seven sites in
   Turkey were above 1000 m. The populations were generally small leaved
   and except for those from low altitude sites in Dagestan and Azerbaijan
   populations were acyanogenic. None of the collected populations were
   significantly higher yielding than `Grassland Huia' in any season.
   However, several populations from the Caucasus were higher yielding than
   `Kent Wild White' and similar to that of `Grassland Tahora.' Survival
   was poor with only four populations having more than 50\% of plants
   surviving after 18 months in this environment. High altitude Caucasus
   populations were earlier flowering than low altitude populations, an
   adaptation to allow adequate seed set.
   There was a negative relationship between altitude of population origin
   and proportion of cyanogenic plants; and between altitude and both leaf
   size and canopy height. High incidence of no leaf mark (vv) was
   associated with populations from colder rather than warmer environments.
   Populations from sites with low rainfall were larger leaved and more
   upright than populations from wetter sites. Populations from severely
   grazed sites were less upright and less cyanogenic than populations from
   infrequently or nil defoliated sites.},

Abstract = {Holstein stud-bulls, selected as improvers, directly have a significant
   impact on the growth rate of live weight of the resulting offspring. The
   live weight of crossbred heifers at 18 months of age was 377-388 kg,
   which is 8-10\% higher than that of pure-bred red-steppe peers. At the
   same time, animals with a blood share of 50 \%, bred ``in themselves{''}
   are characterized by the best indicators of absolute and relative
   increase in live weight and have a more pronounced milky type of
   physique on the exterior. Currently, the main place in the structure of
   the herd of cattle is occupied by the breeding stock, the number of
   which is increasing every year. The proportion of cows in the herd is
   increasing over the years is 46.5\%, and the rest of the livestock is
   also increasing accordingly. When growing heifers of cattle, 55-60\% of
   all costs in the structure of their cost are feed stuff. Consequently,
   the efficiency of rearing is mainly caused by feed conversion ratio
   increase in muscle, fat and bone tissue, which provides a high level of
   efficiency of young animals. In our experience, when growing heifers of
   different genotypes, feeding was carried out according to the norms of
   the All-Russian research Institute of animal husbandry. The diet
   structure contained the required amount of concentrates, hay, silage and
   green fodder.},

Title = {Monitoring diseases of honey bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) in Russia},
Journal = {UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},

Pages = {106-112},
Abstract = {Russia has favorable natural and climatic conditions and forage base for
   the beekeeping development. According to Russian Federal State
   Statistics Service, in 2016 the total number of bee colonies was 3.3
   million, of which 3.1 million or 94\% of the existing bee colonies were
   in private households with 78 regions out of 85 subjects of the Russian
   Federation being engaged in beekeeping. However, climate change, various
   biotic and anthropogenic factors have a negative impact on the state of
   the industry, manifested, first of all, in reducing the productivity of
   bee colonies, their quality, ability to resist diseases. Analysis of the
   results of research on bee colonies from 18 regions of the country
   (Arkhangelsk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Kirov, Leningrad, Moscow, Orenburg,
   Penza, Tomsk, Tula, and Tyumen regions; Altai, Krasnodar, Perm and
   Stavropol krais; republics of Mari El, Tatarstan, and Udmurtia) shows
   that the surveyed apiaries are affected by acariases, bacterioses,
   viroses, mycoses and microsporidioses of bees. The study of bees and
   brood samples showed viruses such as deformed wing virus (DWV), acute
   bee paralysis virus (ABPV), chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV), sacbrood
   virus (SBV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), Kashmir virus (KBV), Israeli
   acute paralysis virus (IAPV); bacteria: Paenibacillus larvae larvae,
   Melissococcus pluton, Escherichia coli; Ascosphaera apis fungus; mites
   Varroa destructor, Acarapis externus, Acarapis woodi Rennie;
   microsporidia Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae. Of the most common mixed
   infection-invasions of bees, the following can be identified:
   varroosis-nosemosis, varroosis-ascosphaerosis,
   varroosis-nosemosis-ascosphaerosis, varroosis-virosis (deformed wing
   virus), varroosis-virosis (sacbrood), varroosis-American foulbrood and
   European foulbrood. Studies conducted in Russia recent years are the
   basis for the development of a monitoring system for bee diseases in the
   country. To obtain objective data, joint efforts of scientists, the
   state veterinary service and owners of apiaries are needed. First of
   all, such kind of events should be held in regions with a large number
   of bee colonies (Altai, Krasnodar and Primorye krais; republics of
   Bashkortostan, Dagestan, Tatarstan, Udmurtia; Belgorod region.) Special
   attention should be paid to breeding farms.},

Abstract = {At the moment, a relevant objective in pharmacognosy, is the use of all
   kinds of the DNA analysis methods for identifying plant materials,
   detecting counterfeits, genetically modified crops and products.
   The aim of the research is to study the possibility of using molecular
   genetic research methods in the analysis of the genus Hedysarum L., for
   the identification of medicinal plant materials. This article presents
   the results of the application of molecular genetic research methods in
   the analysis of the genus Hedysarum L. in the flora of the North
   Caucasus.
   Materials and methods. The study material was the samples of the genus
   Hedysarum L species collected in the North Caucasus: Hedysarum
   caucasicum M. Bieb. (in the fruiting phase in the territory of the
   Karachay-Cherkess Republic); Hedysarum grandiflorum Pall. (in the
   fruiting phase in the Volgograd region); Hedysarum daghestanicum Rupr.
   ex Boiss. (in the flowering phase in the Republic of Dagestan).
   Sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-IT52 marker region of gene 5.8S by the RNA
   ribosome was carried out according to the Sanger method on the AbiPrism
   3130 genetic analyzer at the laboratory of biosystematics and cytology
   of Komarov Botanical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
   Results. Based on a comparative study of the marker region of the
   nuclear ribosomal gene 5.8S rRNA, marker nucleotide substitutions of
   Hedysarum caucasicum M. Bieb., Hedysarum daghestanicum Rupr. ex Boiss.,
   Hedysarum grandiflorum Pall, have been identified. The most probable
   secondary structure of 5.85 rRNA has been constructed. It has been shown
   that based on the analysis performed, it is possible to predict
   additional raw material sources of mangiferin and other groups of
   xanthones using the molecular data exemplified by the Obscura section.
   Conclusion. Based on the data obtained, it can be concluded that the
   morphological classification of the genus Hedysarum L. can be confirmed
   within the Obscura section.},

Abstract = {In the Russian Federation, according to the ``Procedure and conditions
   for appraisal of fine-wool breeds of sheep{''} approved by the Ministry
   of Agriculture on October 5, 2010, by order No. 335, fine-fleeced sheep,
   according to the type of animal and folding of the skin, are divided
   into three groups: animals with insufficient folding of the skin that
   evade the meat type (C-); animals with increased folding on the neck and
   trunk, deviating to a woolly type (C +). The purpose of this work was to
   determine the appropriateness of selecting newborn lambs of the Grozny
   breed by the type of skin folding. The research was carried out during
   the period from 2014 to 2017 in the Limited Liability Company
   ``Plemozvod ``Chervlenye Buruny{''} of the Republic of Dagestan. During
   the lambing period on day 1-3 after the birth, 480 single and double
   lambs of both sexes were selected, which were previously divided into
   three groups according to the type of skin folding. It was found that
   the thickness of the skin of multi-folded animals at the age of 18
   months was 3115.6 mu m, normal folded - 3056.8 mu m and non - folded -
   2864.1 mu m. The number of all hair follicles per 1 mm(2) of skin was
   82.9, 80.1 and 65.1 pieces respectively. The percentage of yield of pure
   wool was greatest in non - folded sheep (54.9 - 56.71\%) and the lowest
   - in multi-folded (51.64 - 55.96\%). The true length of the wool on the
   side at the age of 13 months in single ewes of the type ``C-{''} was
   14.50 cm, type ``C{''} -14.45 cm and type ``C +{''} - 12.24 cm. Animals
   of the type ``C-{''} stand in the first place in the strength of wool,
   this indicator in their topographic areas is equal to: side - 7,48, back
   - 6,18, belly - 5,1 and thigh - 6,91 km. Strength of wool of the type
   ``C{''} in the areas were, respectively, 6.64, 5.56.4.84 and 6.55 cN /
   tex, and of the type ``C +{''} - 6.12; 5.25; 4.48 and 5.76 cN / tex.},

Abstract = {Analysis of the species composition and community structure of helminths
   in saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) was performed using multi-year
   (1979-2013) data collected from the ``Askania Nova{''} Biosphere
   Reserve, Ukraine. During this period, 31 saiga antelopes of different
   ages (7 calves, 24 adults) were examined; totally, more then 63,900
   helminth specimens were collected and identified by morphological
   criteria. Levels of saiga infection by nematodes were from 39 to 671 EPG
   (207 +/- 132 SD); seasonal fluctuations in saiga infections were
   insignificant (Mann-Whitney test; p>0.05). Nineteen helminth species
   were found in saigas in the ``Askania Nova{''}: 3 species of Cestoda
   (Avitellina centripunctata, Moniezia expansa and Taenia hydatigena) and
   16 species of Nematoda (Chabertia ovina, Haemonchus contortus,
   Marshallagia marshalli, Cooperia oncophora, Camelostrongylus mentulatus,
   Aonchotheca bovis, Skrjabinema ovis, Oesophagostomum venulosum,
   Trichostrongylus axei, T. colubriformis, T. probolorus, Ostertagia
   ostertagi, O. circumcincta, O. trifurcata, Nematodirus spp., Trichurus
   ovis). From 2 to 13 species per one host were observed. Nematodes
   dominated within the parasite community and composed more then 99 \% of
   the total helminths found. Significant differences were found in
   helminth diversity between young and adult saigas (p<0.05).
   Prevalence-frequency distribution revealed multimodal structure of
   helminth community with dominant, subdominant, background and rare
   species. The highest number of helminthes (14 species and 50 \% of the
   total amount) inhabited the small intestine; 11 species (45 \%) were
   found in the abomasum and 9 species (5 \%) in the large intestine. The
   Bray-Curtis cluster analysis revealed significant differences within the
   helminth communities in saigas from the ``Askania Nova{''} Biosphere
   Reserve and saigas from Kazakhstan, Dagestan and Kalmykia.},

Abstract = {The results of studying the phytoclimate of a vineyard depending on the
   architecture of the bush are shown. The architecture of grape bushes is
   estimated depending on the system of maintaining and forming the bushes.
   The influence of the shape of the bush and the method of maintaining
   growth on the daily course of the radiation regime and temperature both
   inside the crown and on the aisles of the vineyard is shown. It has been
   established that with semicovering formations with free annual growth,
   the volume of the crown increases, which leads to improved illumination
   of the crown, contributes to a better phytoclimate inside the crown.},

Title = {Land Reforms in Post-Socialist Mountain Regions and their Impact on Land
   Use Management: a Case Study from the Caucasus},
Journal = {REVUE DE GEOGRAPHIE ALPINE-JOURNAL OF ALPINE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {105},

Abstract = {The land reforms of the 1990s in the former Soviet republics led to the
   elimination of the state's monopoly on the ownership of land, a revival
   in local communities and a rise in business activity. The consequences
   of these reforms include the almost total disappearance of collective
   farms and the emergence of the private ownership of land. In the 1990s,
   the state delegated political power, including the disposability of
   land, to local authorities. However, these changes in political power
   varied significantly from region to region. This article aims to explain
   the various institutional environments that have developed at the local
   level in reaction to land reforms. Our investigation of 18 key villages
   in the North Caucasus republics of Karachay-Cherkessia,
   Kabardino-Balkaria, North Ossetia, Ingushetia, Chechnya and Dagestan
   show that land reforms have galvanised multiple actors representing the
   state, as well as collectives, individuals and various formal and
   informal institutions that regulate relations between these actors.
   Along with the political factors -such as the level of centralisation
   and economic liberalisation - that have led to differences in the pace
   of land reforms, local natural and cultural conditions and communities
   play an important role. The latter are characterised either by
   conservatism or by readiness for reforms. Regarding the key villages,
   five different types were identified: 1) villages where most of the land
   has been redistributed among private owners (Karachay-Cherkessia); 2)
   villages that have preserved collective use (some settlements in the
   North Caucasus with mainly Russian population); 3) villages where access
   to land is regulated by the state (Chechnya); 4) villages where access
   to land is regulated by municipal bureaucracy at the district level
   (many other regions in the North Caucasus); and 5) villages where the
   right of access to land is in dispute between the government and the
   business and local communities (e.g. villages in the tourist areas of
   the North Caucasus).},

Abstract = {Species of the genus Helopelius Reitter, 1922 (type species: Stenomax
   aeneipennis Allard, 1876) were known from Rhodes and North Africa. We
   found that two species described from Rhodes belong to the genus
   Stenohelops Reitter, 1922, and Helopelius can be interpreted as a
   subgenus within latter, guided by the article 23.2 of ICZN. The
   following synonyms are proposed: Helopelius, stat. n. (from genus to
   subgenus) = Stenomaleis Espanol, 1957, syn. n.; Stenohelops Reitter,
   1922 = Gunarellus Reitter, 1922, syn. n.; Stenohelops (Helopelius)
   aeneipennis (Allard, 1876) = Helopelius disgregus Reitter, 1922, syn.
   n., = Gunarus gayirbegi Nabozhenko \& Keskin, 2009, syn. n. As a result,
   the following species are transferred from the former genus Helopelius
   to the genus Stenohelops: Stenohelops (Helopelius) nodifer (Kraatz,
   1880), comb. n.; Stenohelops (Helopelius) otini (Antoine, 1949), comb.
   n.; Stenohelops (Helopelius) subsinuatus (Antoine, 1951), comb. n.;
   Stenohelops (Helopelius) verrucosus (Vauloger de Beaupre, 1900), comb.
   n.; Stenohelops (Helopelius) zaianus (Antoine, 1949), comb. n. Thus, the
   subgenus Helopelius contains 11 species from three isolated geographical
   exclaves: Western Mediterranean, Eastern Mediterranean and China
   Lectotypes of Stenomax aeneipennis Allard, 1876, Helops gratus J.
   Frivaldszky, 1894 and Cylindrinotus (Helopelius) disgregus Reitter, 1922
   are designated. Data on fossil species of the genus and the allied
   extinct taxa, as well as on bionomics of extant species of the subgenus
   Helopelius are presented. The check-list for extant and extinct species
   of Stenohelops is given.},

   pandemic, with Australia possibly next in its path. One of the research
   gaps on the disease concerns its main mode of transmission, most likely
   via flying insect vectors such as biting flies or mosquitoes. Direct or
   indirect contact transmission is possible, but appears to be an
   inefficient route, although there is evidence to support the direct
   contact route for the newly detected recombinant strains first isolated
   in Russia. In this study, we used experimental bulls and fed them via
   virus-inoculated feed to evaluate the indirect contact route. To provide
   deeper insights, we ran two parallel experiments using the same design
   to discover differences that involved classical field strain
   Dagestan/2015 LSDV and recombinant vaccine-like Saratov/2017. Following
   the attempted indirect contact transmission of the virus from the
   inoculated feed via the alimentary canal, all bulls in the Dagestan/2015
   group remained healthy and did not seroconvert by the end of the
   experiment, whereas for those in the Saratov/2017 recombinant virus
   group, of the five bulls fed on virus-inoculated feed, three remained
   clinically healthy, while two displayed evidence of a mild infection.
   These results provide support for recombinant virus transmission via the
   alimentary canal. In addition, of particular note, the negative control
   in-contact bull in this group exhibited a biphasic fever at days 10 and
   20, developed lesions from day 13 onwards, and seroconverted by day 31.
   Two explanations are feasible here: one is the in-contact animal was
   somehow able to feed on some of the virus-inoculated bread left over
   from adjacent animals, but in the case here of the individual troughs
   being used, that was not likely; the other is the virus was transmitted
   from the virus-fed animals via an airborne route. Across the infected
   animals, the virus was detectable in blood from days 18 to 29 and in
   nasal discharge from days 20 to 42. Post-mortem and histological
   examinations were also indicative of LSDV infection, supporting further
   evidence for rapid, in F transmission of this virus. This is the first
   report of recombinant LSDV strain transmitting via the alimentary mode.},

Abstract = {Celonites ivanovi sp. nov. is described as a new species from Dagestan
   where it has been recorded from dry habitats in a small area on the
   northern side of the Greater Caucasus. Celonites cagrii sp. nov. is
   described from Erzurum Province in east Turkey. As in other members of
   the C. cyprius-group, the females of both species were observed to visit
   flowers of Heliotropium (Boraginaceae). A morphological examination
   including the male genitalia of all species of the C. cyprius-group
   revealed that C. ivanovi sp. nov. and C. cagrii sp. nov. share the
   apomorphic characters of this group and are closely related to Celonites
   osseus Morawitz, 1888. Mean genetic distance between C. ivanovi sp. nov.
   and C. cagrii sp. nov. based on COI-5 sequences is 7.40\%. The
   geographical distribution of all members of the C. cyprius-group is
   summarized and an illustrated key is provided for the identification of
   males and females of the species. A lectotype is designated for C.

Abstract = {Triticum sinskajae A. Filat. et Kurk. has been discovered in the early
   1970s during the reproduction of Triticum monococcum L. accession
   k-20970. It is still debated whether it is a new species or a
   spontaneous mutant of T. monococcum. Although T. sinskajae appears to be
   genetically distinct from several T. monococcum lineages, there is still
   no data on the differences from accession k-20970, from which it may
   have originated. The purpose of this study was to compare the
   chloroplast genomes of T. sinskajae and T. monococcum accession k-20970
   and clarify the phylogenetic relationships between einkorn wheats.
   Complete chloroplast genomes of T. sinskajae k-48993 (Dagestan), T.
   monococcum k-20970 (Turkey), T. boeoticum k-58674 (Armenia) have been
   sequenced and annotated for the first time. Chloroplast genome sequences
   of T. monococcum subsp. monococcum and T. urartu were used for
   comparative analysis. However T. monococcum k-20970 and T. sinskajae
   k-48993 had common mutations that were absent in T. monococcum subsp.
   monococcum, they also were polymorphic in 10 nucleotides, including 1
   transversion, 1 deletion, 4 insertions and 4 bp inversion of AGAA to
   TTCT in the rbcL-psal intergenic region. Due to genetic and phenotypic
   differences T. sinskajae k-48993 and T. monococcum k-20970 can be
   considered different species. A comparison of the chloroplast genomes of
   einkorn wheats showed a common origin of the plastomes of three closely
   related species -T. sinskajae, T. monococcum and T. boeoticum, while T.
   urartu can be assigned to another clade.},

Abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) belongs to a group of
   anthroponotic viral diseases that cause HIV infection in the human body,
   apotheosely transforming into acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
   HIV infection, in people without adequate treatment, can lead to serious
   damage to the immune system (hereinafter referred to as IS), which leads
   to a sharp decrease in resistance to conditionally pathogenic microbes,
   as well as to the prevalence of oncological pathologies that may lead to
   death. Due to its simplicity, convenience, efficiency and

Abstract = {A study was made of the features of the soil cover of solonetz complexes
   in different parts of the pasture of an average sheep farm in the dry
   steppe zone in the Manych river basin in the conditions of dissected
   relief. It has been established that several types of soil cover can be
   distinguished on the territory of the pasture that differ in the degree
   of transformation of the profile of different components of the solonetz
   complex under the influence of intensive grazing. It is shown that the
   heterogeneity of the soil cover is due to the uneven impact of grazing,
   which, in turn, is determined both by the degree of remoteness from the
   farm and by the characteristics of the vegetation cover in different
   parts of the pasture. The areas with a well-pronounced complexity of the
   soil cover and a high proportion of solonetzes, dominated by
   grass-wormwood associations, are subject to the greatest pasture load. A
   tendency to a reduction in the thickness of the AJ and SEL horizons of
   light chestnut soils and solonetzes was noted as the pasture load
   increased. In the soil cover of feather grass areas of pastures, the
   share of solonetzes is much lower, which can be associated with a
   short-term pasture load on these soils.},

Abstract = {Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease that causes enormous losses in
   livestock production worldwide and has a significant public health
   impact. None of the brucellosis -free countries is currently able to
   guarantee their ability to prevent the introduction of the pathogen due
   to the increase in tourism and the expansion of migration. The timely
   identification of infected animals is an effective means of preventing
   brucellosis and minimizing the epidemiological risk. The tube
   agglutination test, Rose Bengal plate test, complement fixation test,
   and enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay, which are routinely used to
   identify seropositive productive animals, have limitations and results
   that do not always correlate. The indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA)
   stands out among non-traditional methods because it is affordable, has a
   simple protocol, and is more reliable than classical serological tests,
   especially in cases of questionable and/or false -negative results. The
   diagnostic value of the IHA has long been studied by laboratories in
   several countries, but mostly by post -soviet research teams; therefore,
   the results continue to be published in Russian -language journals,
   ensuring that the local scientific community can access the results. In
   addition, the efficacy of this test for the diagnosis of brucellosis and
   other infectious diseases has not yet been reviewed. The purpose of this
   review was to summarize the results of studies on the development and
   use of IHA for the diagnosis of brucellosis and to determine the
   prospects for further improvement.},

   bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) plants
   grown in nosterile culture and of explants from these organs grown in
   vitro were studied. Salt stress was produced by adding NaCl (0.5 and
   1.0\%) to water or the Murashige and Skoog nutrient medium. Salt stress
   suppressed rhizogenesis, particularly profoundly in the salt-sensitive
   beans. Callus cultures obtained from different organs differed in their
   salt tolerance, which was evaluated from the callus growth. Under
   salinity conditions, homologous structures of the two crops differed
   markedly in survival and regeneration. Different organs and
   corresponding explants of one and the same plant differed in the
   threshold sensitivity to salinity, which indicates the organ-specificity
   of salt resistance.},

Abstract = {Two nests of Hoplitis curvipes are described from Apulia (Italy) and
   Dagestan (Russia). Both nests consisted of two brood cells placed side
   by side under a stone. The cells were neither attached to each other nor
   to the substrate. They were constructed from leaf fragments, which were
   imbricately arranged, forming a cone-like structure; each leaf fragment
   consisted of a basal part that was masticated to leaf pulp and an apical
   part that protruded freely from the cell wall. The cell wall was formed
   by the fusion of the masticated basal parts of the leaf fragments and
   thus entirely consisted of leaf pulp. The cell was sealed with a closing
   plug made of pure leaf pulp; a few leaf fragments were glued to its
   outer surface. The cocoon consisted of two layers: the outer layer was
   restricted to the anterior portion of the cell and had several
   longitudinal air-exchange slits on its lateral surface, while the inner
   layer had an air-exchange orifice in its most anterior dome-shaped top.
   Results of measurements of brood cell dimensions and contents are
   provided. The nesting biology of species of the H. curvipes group is
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the clinical research of cows during the
   interlactation period, through reviewing their medical histories and the
   clinical examination of the animals and their milk glands, trial milking
   and organoleptic evaluation of the secretion. The secretion was
   evaluated according to its color, texture, smell and the presence of
   foreign substances. The best therapeutic dosage of Vetom-3, a medicine
   based on Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, was determined through the
   examination of 30 non-milking cows suffering from subclinical mastitis.
   The probiotic and difumast were injected into the milk glands of the
   cows diagnosed with subclinical mastitis two weeks prior to the expected
   calving and in accordance with the examination results received on the
   4th day of lactation. After the treatment, the milk was fed to the
   calves. The evaluation of the change rates of the microflora composition
   was carried out using calf feces samples. The bacteriological tests of
   the microflora were carried out using the standard procedures for
   determining the morphological properties of germ cultures. We
   ascertained that the use of Vetom-3, a medicine based on Bacillus
   amyloliquefaciens RNCIM V-10642 (DSM 24614), for the treatment of
   subclinical mastitis in non-milking cows allows to increase the
   efficiency of the treatment, as well as receive the milk of high
   sanitary quality, increase the survival rate of the newborn calves, and
   prevent dysbacteriosis and dyspepsy incidence in newborn calves.},

Abstract = {Beautiful Vavilovia {[}Vavilovia formosa (Stev.) Fed.] is a perennial
   legume of great importance for the evolution and taxonomy of the tribe
   Fabeae Rchb. The abundant data on its collection sites on the Caucasus
   Mountains, made during the past two centuries, were collated and
   analysed. The studied area covers the mountain ranges of both the
   Greater and Lesser Caucasus in Russian Federation, Georgia, Armenia and
   Azerbaijan, except the ranges in north-eastern and eastern Turkey and
   north-western Iran. The presented data are the results of an analysis of
   the herbarium collections of various institutions and available
   literature resources, providing novel information about 110 collection
   points. The analysed data allowed to specify the borders of the area in
   the region, as well as describe the features of the high-altitude
   distribution of V. formosa within the studied area, revealing the lower
   and upper altitude ranges as between 2021 and 3500 m above sea level.
   The results also indicate a reduction of the number of its populations,
   as well as the necessity and urgency of monitoring and protecting all
   the known locations of this highly endangered species.},

Abstract = {This article is dedicated to analyzing epidemiological situation of
   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in the subjects of the North Caucasian
   Federal District (from 2005 to 2021) and developing a new approach to
   improve epidemiological forecasting by using an in-progress
   ``prognostic{''} model. The study is comprehensive, using
   epidemiological methods and mathematical statistics. The epidemiological
   analysis was carried out based on information from the databases on the
   incidence rate for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever presented as a
   project and maps of infectious disease focus epidemiological
   examination. The ``prognostic{''} morbidity model is developed based on
   Bayes' theorem and Wald's sequential statistical analysis. The factors
   information calculation was carried out by using the Kullback method.
   The value of climatic factors was retrieved from the database of the
   Center for Collective Use ``IKI-monitoring{''} of the Space Research
   Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The data obtained indicate
   that the majority of patients with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
   within the studied long-term period in the Stavropol Territory (629) and
   the Republic of Dagestan (46) were revealed. Isolated cases in the
   Kabardino-Balkarian Republic (2), the Karachay-Cherkess Republic (3) and
   the Republic of Ingushetia (2) were noted. Infection by the
   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever causative agent via the transmission
   mechanism occurred mainly during the care after farm animals in 59.4\%.
   The prevalence of moderate forms of CrimeanCongo hemorrhagic fever
   (79\%) was noted, with hemorrhagic manifestations (over the last five
   years) observed almost in half of the patients. The proportion of
   correct preliminary diagnoses during patient hospitalization was 49\%.
   While testing the ``prognostic{''} model in 2021 particularly in the
   Stavropol Territory, a complete exact coincidence for predicted and the
   actual data was obtained for 11 districts (42.3\%). False positive
   (38.5\%) and overestimated (11.5\%) data at this stage of the study do
   not significantly reduce the predictive value of the model, since they
   often reflect registered infection case that occurred at the patient's
   place of residence in another administrative region, underdiagnoses of
   mild forms of CrimeanCongo hemorrhagic fever in medical institutions or
   high efficiency of preventive measures against ticks measures carried
   out before the beginning of the epidemic season in individual municipal
   districts. False negative results were 7.7\%. Thus, the results of the
   analysis evidence about a need to improve the training of medical
   personnel for the timely detection of patients with Crimean-Congo
   hemorrhagic fever and to enhance the effectiveness of preventive
   measures against ticks. The results of testing the ``prognostic{''}
   model confirm the feasibility and hold promise to continue the study.},

Abstract = {The feeding levels and the consumption of nutrients and energy by
   Ciscaucasian hamster reach their maximum in agroecosystems with abundant
   grain foods. These parameters, are stable between years;and seasons and
   do not depend on the dynamics of the crops and nutritiousness of natural
   foods (21 to 22g of dry weight and 279 to 309kJ per individual a day
   resp.). The absolute values of daily energy consumption exceed daily
   requirement (206 +/- 16.5 kJ per individual) almost in all periods of
   activity and cause regular increase of body weight throughout entire
   period of activity. This determines the maximum level of reproduction
   (89-98\%), the minimum level of winter mortality (22-54\%) and the
   highest and stable density for years (34-35 animals per ha). In the
   absence of grain grain foods, feeding levels and consumption of
   nutrients are determined by the dynamics of natural foods. Seasonal and
   annual dynamics of these indices cause significant fluctuations of
   reproductive intensity, mortality and migration between years. Even in
   optimum natural biotopes, the population density does not exceed 3 or 5
   animals per ha and varies significantly between years.},

Abstract = {Our research attempts 1) to link the distribution and abundance of
   eastern tur (Capra cylindricornis) to environmental variables varying in
   space and time, and 2) to identify environmental constraints that may
   have caused the geographic segregation of eastern tur from western tur
   (Capra caucasica). Our results suggest that 1) eastern tur are
   heat-sensitive but prefer snow-free, grass-dominated areas near escape
   cliffs, and in terrain that is difficult for humans and livestock to
   reach; and 2) present-day genetic and phenotypic differences between the
   Capra species are largely related to discontinuity of and impeded
   migration between Capra populations during glacial periods, and
   insufficient time in the postglacial period for now-adjoining Capra
   populations to overcome behavioral mechanisms impeding hybridization in
   the wild so as to erase these differences.},

Title = {Experimental and modeling study of isothermal VLE properties of the

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE TAIWAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Backgrounds: For the design and development of a method utilizing SC
   C3H8 for the chemical synthesis like the production of active pharma
   ingredients (pharmaceutical applications) and crop protection agents, it
   is essential to understand the solubility and other properties of
   benzylamine as an industrial important compound in the SC C3H8. Methods:
   A high-temperature and high-pressure optical cell has been used to
   measure the phase equilibrium properties (PTxy) of the binary SC C3H8 +
   benzylamine mixture. The experimental and modeling studies of the
   isothermal VLE properties (solubility, PTxy relationship) of benzylamine
   in the supercritical (SC) C3H8 along the four selected constant
   temperatures of (393.15, 413.15, 433.15, and 473.15) K over the pressure
   range from (0.9 to 9.5) MPa have been performed in the present work.
   Significant Findings: It was found the Perturbed-Chain Statistical
   Association Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) is less accurate than its Critical
   Point-based revision (CP-PC-SAFT) in predicting the new VLE data in the
   C3H8 + benzylamine binary system with k12 = 0. Both models substantially
   deviate from the bubble point data at pressures below 2 MPa.},

Abstract = {Caucasian tur (Capra caucasica) is native to Greater Caucasus Mountain
   Chain from Azerbaijan and Georgia in the East to Krasnodar region of
   Russia in the West. This species is divided into two subspecies (by some
   authors into species)-East-Caucasian tur and West-Caucasian tur and a
   subpopulation referred to as Mid-Caucasian tur. Up to date most of the
   genetic studies of Caucasian tur are based on mitochondrial DNA
   sequences and comprehensive investigation based on nuclear DNA is
   required for clarification of its genetic diversity and population
   structure. In our work, we assessed the applicability of Illumina Goat
   SNP50 BeadChip for genetic studies of Caucasian tur. Total of 15
   specimens of Capra caucasica including East-Caucasian tur from Dagestan
   (E\_TUR, n = 5), West-Caucasian tur from Karachay-Cherkessia (W\_TUR, n
   = 5), and Mid-Caucasian tur from Kabardino-Balkaria (M\_TUR, n = 5) were
   genotyped. After quality control, 5544 polymorphic loci, which were
   distributed all over 29 autosomes, were detected. The lowest number of
   SNPs was found on the 25th chromosome-68, and the highest on the 1st
   chromosome-348. It was shown that all the three groups of Caucasian tur
   clustered separately. A total of 2061 SNPs were common for all the
   populations, 594 were found only in W\_TUR, 689 in E\_TUR, and 530 in
   M\_TUR. Individual heterozygosity ranged from 0.273 to 0.282 in W\_TUR,
   from 0.217 to 0.253 in E\_TUR, and from 0.255 to 0.283 in M\_TUR. A
   clinal pattern of genetic variation was revealed. It was suggested to
   consider Caucasian tur a single species with several ecotypes. Thus, in
   our study we demonstrated that the Illumina Goat SNP50 BeadChip
   developed for domestic goats can be used as a useful tool for genetic
   studies of Caucasian tur.},

Abstract = {An amount of energy obtained by Meriones tamariscinus in nature
   fluctuates in seasons and in years and is determined by natural changes
   of calorific value of the consumed fodder and by the changes of the real
   value (the mass) of its daily consumption. The amount of a fodder
   consumed depends on the crop (r = 0.72-0.92; p < 0.001) and varies in
   different seasons and years from 4.0 to 9.9 gr dry weight per day.
   Nutritiousness of the consumed fodder also changes much with the season
   (1658-1900 kj/100 gr of dried substance) according to the change of the
   nutritiousness of the pasture vegetation (1583-1750 kj). Absolute values
   of the daily energy consumption vary in parallel from 70 to 140 kj per
   individual. Depending on the concrete season conditions and on the state
   of food resources, the energy consumption is lower (summer, winter) or
   higher (spring, autumn) than daily requirements of animals (96-105 kj
   for a grown up non-reproducing individual). Disparity between the needs
   and the consumption causes the decrease (in summer and winter) or
   increase (in spring and autumn) of the body weight which reflects the
   physiological conditions of individuals and, as a result, effects the
   state (reproduction rate, death rate and numbers) of the whole
   population.},

Title = {Ecology and distribution of the Amur Chebachok <i>Pseudorasbora
   parva</i> (Temminck et Schlegel, 1846) as a biologically invasive
   species in the delta and estuarine coast of the river Don},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {Aim. To analyze the results of ichthyological monitoring in order to
   identify the role of an invasive fish species, Pseudorasbora parva -
   known in Russia as the Amur Chebachok - in the ichthyological community
   of the River Don estuary littoral and delta.
   Material and Methods. Research work was carried out in the prodelta and
   estuarine watercourses of the Don delta in the period 2007-2017. To
   catch the fish, we used bimtral, drag nets, gill nets and other fishing
   gear. Standard methods were applied to process ichthyological material.
   A total of 902 specimens of the Amur chebachok were examined.
   Results. The general characteristics of the invasive species from
   watercourses of the delta and from Taganrog Bay are given. Its role in
   the formation of ichthyofauna and its relationship with native species
   in new habitats has been determined. Dimension-mass indicators and other
   biological parameters of the species are given.
   Conclusion. The linear structure of the local population of the Amur
   chebachok consists of different size groupings corresponding to certain
   ages. The process of acclimatization of the Amur chebachok in the Don
   delta is associated with certain interactions with elements of the local
   biocenosis. It was proved that when there is a high number, both in pond
   farms and in natural water bodies, the species is an acute food
   competitor to juveniles of both farmed or local fish. Its rapid spread
   is due to the high survival rate of offspring, high environmental
   plasticity, rapid growth, short puberty and the migratory activity of
   larvae and fry.},

Abstract = {On the basis of archival materials and special historical literature,
   land-legal relations among the Nogais in the second half of the 19th -
   early 20th centuries are considered. The relevance of the problem stated
   in the article lies in the fact that land and legal relations among the
   Nogais of the region are poorly understood. The ways of implementing the
   agrarian policy of the Russian government in the Eastern Ciscaucasia are
   described on the example of the Nogais. It is argued that administrative
   pressure occupied a prominent place among the methods of influencing the
   nomadic population. It is noted that at the same time, financial
   assistance played a significant role in attracting nomadic Nogais to a
   settled way of life. It is clarified that finances played a role in
   attracting the poor population to change their lifestyle. It is
   concluded that, despite the difficulties, the agrarian reform in the
   territory of the plain Ciscaucasia predetermined the transition of a
   significant part of the representatives of the Nogai community to
   settled agriculture and animal husbandry. It is emphasized that in the
   course of the agrarian reform the Nogai community has undergone a
   significant transformation. It is noted that a smaller part of the Nogai
   society still retained a nomadic lifestyle, but for short distances.},

Abstract = {To study the diversity of agromizids (leaf miners) in the South
   Caucasus, the species external morphological features, their host
   plants, the development of larvae and pupae and to assess the degree of
   crop infestation by leaf -miners. The study was carried out within the
   framework of the scs 21-002 scientific program ``Leaf miners as pests of
   agricultural plants (Diptera: Agromyzidae): the latest control
   measures{''}. Type samples were fixed in 75 \% ethyl alcohol and
   deposited in the Agrarian Scientific Research Laboratory of the
   Scientific Centre of Zoology and Hydroecology. Species were identified
   by examining the male genitalia. The degree of damage of the host-plant
   was determined based on intensity indicators. As a result of this
   research, a new species of the Calycomyza genus was discovered in the
   South Caucasus fauna. Larvae of C. jucunda (Wulp, 1867) were found on
   the leaves of Beta vulgaris, a host plant mentioned for the first time
   here. As a Nearctic species, it was also first discovered in the
   southern Caucasus. The study of the male genitalia indicates expansion
   of the biogeographical distribution of Calycomyza species, as most of
   them are found in the Nearctic and Neotropical regions. In terms of
   intensity, C. jucunda is classified as a less dangerous species for
   agricultural crops.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of the research is to study the features of the
   sustainable development of agro-industrial enterprises in the conditions
   of sanctions on the example of modern Russia.
   Design/methodology/approach: Sustainable development of agro-industrial
   enterprises means their ability to show signs of stable (crisis-free)
   functioning and development-non-zero (positive) profit, profitability,
   value addition, sales volume. To study the features of the sustainable
   development of agro-industrial enterprises in the conditions of
   sanctions, the authors use methods of trend and correlation analysis of
   statistical data. To obtain the most complete and reliable information,
   the agro-industrial complex is considered in the context of its two key
   segments-agriculture and agricultural engineering (agricultural
   machinery production). Statistics on the selected segments of the
   agro-industrial complex of Russia for the period of sanctions
   (2014-2018) were investigated. Findings: The following features of the
   sustainable development of agro-industrial enterprises in the context of
   sanctions were identified. Firstly, the reorientation to the domestic
   market, as well as the transition of Russian agricultural export
   enterprises to alternative goods (export facilities) and other foreign
   trade partners. Secondly, active and highly efficient import
   substitution, which ensures the accelerated development of domestic
   entrepreneurship and its formation as a vector of growth of the Russian
   economy. Thirdly, the deterioration in the financial performance of
   Russian agro-industrial enterprises during the period of economic
   sanctions, indicating a violation of their stability, but subsequently
   replaced by stabilization (restoration of stability). Fourth, the
   accelerated modernization of agro-industrial enterprises and the
   establishment of their subsidiary dependence. Fifth, the increased
   complexity of managing the sustainable development of agro-industrial
   enterprises. Originality/value: The deterministic features of Russian
   experience indicate that international trade and economic sanctions
   initially cause a moderate crisis of agro-industrial enterprises, but
   subsequently contribute to their sustainable development of domestic
   entrepreneurship both on the basis of the domestic market and on the
   basis of exports in new directions. The scale of benefits depends on the
   flexibility and adaptability of the enterprise.},

Abstract = {German migration to the Russian state has a long history. Between the
   sixteenth and the mid-eighteenth centuries, prisoners of war captured
   during the Livonian War (1558-1583) and persons invited to Russia by the
   Muscovite grand princes and Russian tsars (Ivan III, Ivan IV, Peter I,
   etc.) settled in Russia. In the second half of the eighteenth century,
   the resettlement of Germans became part of the state's migration policy,
   which determined the fate of one of the empire's most numerous ethnic
   minorities for many decades. This article deals with changes to the
   administration of German rural settlements in the Russian Empire in the
   second half of the nineteenth century. This period was important for the
   legal status of foreign colonies due to the adoption of the Statute of
   Colonies of 1857, which provided detailed regulation of the rights and
   obligations of foreign colonists. One of the tasks of the political,
   economic, and social reforms of the 1860s-1870s was the unification of
   the rural population and the elimination of the social exclusivity of
   foreign colonists. A pragmatic approach regarding the use of colonists
   for the settlement and rational development of empty territories brought
   positive results for these regions. The analysis here makes it possible
   to consider the measures taken by the Russian authorities to streamline
   the legislation, norms, and rules for the economic, administrative,
   everyday, and spiritual life of German colonists. With the help of
   comparative analysis, the authors study changes in state policy towards
   foreign colonists and the abolition of privileges as a result of the
   adoption of the law ``the supremely approved rules about the management
   of settler-owners (former colonists){''} on 4 June 1871. The study makes
   it possible to assess the impact of large-scale administrative changes
   on various spheres of life and activities of the German colonists, a
   separate category of the Russian Empire's population.},

Abstract = {The analysis of diseases occurring is given in animals in the first 100
   DIM. Determined milk content: MF, MP, pH, Ur, BHBA, Ac, calculated FPR.
   INCD in milk cows in the first 100 DIM is the second most widespread -
   30.72 \%. Among INCD, DSD and RSD predominate in the former - 38.8 \%
   each, DMEO accounts for 20.4 \% of disease cases. In 17.05 \% of the
   examined animals, the FPR corresponded to optimal values, and in 82.95
   \% it was 1.10 or less, which may indicate the spread of subacute
   subclinical rumen acidosis in the animals of the studied population.
   Exceeding the upper limit of FPR, indicating the presence of ketosis in
   animals, has not been established. Studies revealed a double excess of
   Ur content in milk, and in animals with normal FPR values, the Ur
   content was 11.15 \% (p < 0.001) higher than in animals with reduced
   FPR. The pH of milk generally corresponded to the values of the
   physiological norm. The level of BHBA in milk was below the threshold
   values, but in the animal's group with FPR 1.10 or less, the BHBA
   content in milk significantly (by 80.0 \%, p < 0.01) exceeded the BHBA
   content in animals with normal FPR values. Cows with a normal FPR value,
   the Ac level in milk was found to exceed the threshold value by 28.57
   \%, and in animals with low FPR values, the established excess was
   141.43 \% (p <0.05).},

Abstract = {Pulsatilla (Anemoneae, Ranunculaceae) is sister to Anemone s.s. and
   contains ca 40 perennial species of considerable horticultural and
   medical importance. We sequenced 31 of those species, plus nine
   subspecies, two cultivars and six outgroups, for two nuclear regions
   (high-copy nrITS and low-copy MLH1) and three plastid regions (rbcL,
   accD-psaL trnL intron) in order to generate the first comprehensive
   species-level phylogeny of the genus. Phylogenetic trees were
   constructed using both concatenation-based (maximum likelihood and
   Bayesian inference) and coalescence methods. The better supported among
   the internal nodes were subjected to molecular clock dating and
   ancestral area reconstruction, and karyotypic characters identified by
   us using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization were mapped across the tree.
   The preferred species tree from the coalescence analysis formed the
   basis of a new infrageneric classification based on monophyly plus
   degree of divergence. The earliest divergent of the three subgenera,
   Kostyczewianae, is represented by only a single species that is
   morphologically intermediate between Anemone s.s. and `core' Pulsatilla.
   Subgenus Pulsatilla is considerably richer in species than its sister
   subgenus Preonanthus and contains three monophyletic sections. Species
   possessing nodding flowers and pectinately dissected leaves are
   phylogenetically derived compared with groups possessing erect flowers
   and palmately lobed leaves. Pulsatilla separated from Anemone s.s. at ca
   25 Ma. Our results indicate a central Asian mountain origin of the genus
   and an initial diversification correlated with late Tertiary global
   cooling plus regional mountain uplift, aridification and consequent
   expansion of grasslands. The more rapid and extensive diversification
   within subgenus Pulsatilla began at ca 3 Ma and continued throughout the
   Quaternary, driven not only by major perturbations in global climate but
   also by well-documented polyploidy.},

Abstract = {With regard to environmental concerns, energy consumption is another
   major issue in high-performance systems. This paper examines the
   scheduling problem in a multi-machine system where the machine's engine
   speed can be adjusted over an interrupt interval. Adjusting the CPU by
   sacrificing the completion time delivers flexibility to minimize the
   cost of electricity in terms of energy savings. Traditional research
   focuses on machine planning on assignment of work and sequencing to
   optimize specific target functions that are defined to complete work
   time. In the above circumstances, the purpose of the study is to assign
   the works to machines, as well as to determine the sequence of tasks and
   the speed of each machine to minimize the objective function, including
   to minimize tardiness penalty and energy cost with sequence dependent
   set-up times. We proposed two fragmentary algorithms based on the PSO
   and Genetic Algorithm (GA) algorithms. In this paper, the application of
   these two algorithms for minimizing tardiness penalty and energy cost
   with sequence dependent set-up times is examined. Finally, the
   algorithms are compared and the results are compared.},

Abstract = {Aim. This study was an attempt by the authors to identify the impact of
   oil production in the Caspian Sea on the quality of waters surrounding
   oil and gas-production platforms.
   Material and Methods. In 2018, by order of the Committee for Forestry
   and Wildlife of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of
   Kazakhstan, Kazekoproekt carried out comprehensive marine research to
   assess the state of biological resources in the eastern part of the
   Caspian Sea. All studies were carried out according to standard methods
   accepted in international practice. Samples were collected in summer
   (July-August) 2018 and autumn (September) 2018.
   Results. An analysis of the materials of environmental studies carried
   out in the water area of the eastern part of the Caspian Sea in 2018
   established the absence of biogenic concentrations in sea water in
   excess of the standard indicators. It was found that in the waters
   surrounding several stations in summer and autumn, concentrations of oil
   products were exceeded. The concentrations of pesticides in the waters
   of the northern Caspian Sea recorded in 2018 were not detected.
   Conclusion. It was found that in the eastern part of the Caspian Sea in
   2018 there was no concentration of biogenic elements in sea water above
   the standard indicators. Of the heavy metals, an excess of maximum
   permissible concentrations was found only at one station - of copper in
   the summer over 159 sq. m and in the autumn over 121 sq. m. Of
   particular concern is the fact that at several stations in summer and
   autumn excessive concentrations of petroleum products were recorded. The
   concentrations of pesticides in the waters of the northern Caspian Sea
   recorded in 2018 were not detected.},

Title = {On the fauna of parasites of the gastrointestinal tract of small

Abstract = {The aim of the research is to study the parasitic invasion of small
   ruminants in the mountainous zone of Armenia during summer and autumn,
   in this case to determine the invasiveness of parasites of the digestive
   tract of sheep. The material was feces collected from sheep on pastures
   in the coastal zone of the Getik River during 2022. The work was carried
   out at the Scientific Centre of Zoology and Hydroecology, National
   Academy of Sciences, Republic of Armenia. The material researched also
   included mollusks and oribatid mites - intermediate hosts of
   biohelminths. As a result of the study of parasitic invasion of small
   ruminants in the mountain zone of Armenia, the taxonomic composition of
   parasites was determined. Helminths found in sheep belong to the classes
   Trematoda, Nematoda, and Cestoda, protozoa - to the class Protozoa. In
   the autumn season, representatives of seven genera of parasites of the
   gastrointestinal tract were found - Moniezia, , Dicrocoelium, ,
   Fasciola, , Nematodirus, , Strongylus, , Trichuris, , Eimeria, , while
   in the summer season, only representatives of five genera were found -
   Moniezia, , Dicrocoelium, , Nematodirus, , Strongylus, , Eimeria. . As a
   result of these studies, it can be concluded that natural and climatic
   factors of the environment have a significant impact on the structure of
   the helminth complex of sheep in the mountain region of Armenia. All
   parasites found can have a detrimental effect on the sheep's body.
   However, the severity of the invasion in the samples taken is not at the
   level that could lead to serious diseases in sheep. This suggests that
   the treatment methods used on farms are at a fairly high level.},

Abstract = {In the paper there are presented magnetic, magnetoelectric, and
   magnetocaloric properties of the Fe48Rh52-PZT bilayer multiferroic
   composite close to room temperature. The maximum of adiabatic
   temperature change as well as the large magnetoelectric ordering around
   the antiferromagnetic-magnetic phase transition temperature of 315K for
   a magnetic field change of 0.62T is demonstrated. The application of a
   voltage across the bilayer structure shifts the metamagnetic transition
   by similar to 4 K in cooling and by similar to 3 K in heating. The
   magnitude of the magnetoelectric and magnetocaloric effects depends on
   the strain/stress in the magnetic layer induced by the piezoelectric one
   as a result of applying electric field. Such a finding can be
   successfully employed for controlling of the magnetic properties of
   caloric materials. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Most recent composition of the ornithofauna of the Middle Irtysh region,

Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {Aim. The work was to compile a list of bird species and their status in
   the forest-steppe and steppe of the Middle Irtysh region at the present
   time and to analyse their potential ability in terms of the transmission
   of influenza viruses that pose a danger to humans and farm
   animals.Materials and Methods. The study of avifauna and their status in
   the forest-steppe and steppe of the Middle Irtysh region has been
   conducted by us from 1973 to the present. The analysis of literary
   sources has been carried out since the time of P.S. Pallas's travels in
   the region in 1871. In addition, information on the wetlands of the
   Irtysh region which is freely available on the Internet was
   used.Results. At the beginning of the 20th century, about 200 species of
   birds were recorded in the vicinity of Omsk, 125 of them being breeding
   species. At present about 150 species of birds have been recorded in
   Omsk and its environs. Of the 290 bird species of the Middle Irtysh
   region, 48 species (16.6\%) belong among the natural hosts of influenza
   A viruses. Of these, at least 40 species are migratory and 25 species
   nest there. In addition to the prinicipal influenza virus host species,
   the list of birds of the Middle Irtysh region includes several species
   of scavengers and predators, as well as synanthropic bird species. These
   species may share habitat or food resources with the main host species
   of influenza viruses. Influenza A viruses can be transmitted between
   species either by direct or indirect contact through mechanical
   propagation or contamination of nutritional resources.Conclusion. As the
   3 largest bird migratory flyways run through the Middle Irtysh region
   where there is a significant number of wetlands, the prerequisites are
   created for a mass simultaneous accumulation of different populations
   and species of migratory birds carrying viruses and, accordingly, a high
   probability of exchanging viral genomes with each other and their
   further spread to new regions.},

Abstract = {The growth of the investment activity in the Russian agro-industrial
   complex (AIC) is substantiated by the specificity of the agro-industrial
   production, the functioning of which is related to overcoming the
   following systemic problems: underdevelopment of infrastructure
   facilities, shortage of qualified production and management personnel,
   and a low level of developing scientifically grounded economic forms.
   The article introduces methods for supporting the AIC investment
   activity, including the economic methods that were recognized as the
   most preferable ones. The following instruments that have a direct
   financial influence in the taxation, credit-and-monetary, budgetary and
   external economic areas have been defined within economic methods:
   provision of tax credits for the placed investments (so-called tax
   credit); provision of tax incentives and special tax regimes for
   investors at AIC enterprises; accelerated depreciation of fixed capital;
   targeted lending of AIC enterprises for investment purposes; subsidies
   and subventions from local budgets for AIC enterprises; forming and
   funding of AIC investment projects from regional budgets; provision of
   budgetary guarantees to AIC private investors; attracting foreign
   investment in the region AIC; provision of privileges (taxation,
   lending) to AIC enterprises that participate in the foreign economic
   activity, etc. The sequence of organizing investment processes in AIC is
   shown. The normative and legal support for the AIC investment activity
   in the form of a three-level system of normative acts is given.},

Abstract = {Let = \{t(0), t(1), ..., t(N)\} and (N) = \{x(0), x(1), ..., x(N-1)\},
   where x(j) = (t(j) + t(j + 1))/2, j = 0, 1, ..., N-1 be arbitrary
   systems of distinct points of the segment {[}-1, 1]. For each function
   f(x) continuous on the segment {[}-1, 1], we construct discrete Fourier
   sums S-n,S- N( f, x) with respect to the system of polynomials
   \{p(k,N)(x)\}k=0N-1, forming an orthonormal system on nonuniform point
   systems (N) consisting of finite number N of points from the segment
   {[}-1, 1] with weight t(j) = t(j + 1)-t(j). We find the growth order for
   the Lebesgue function L-n,L-N (x) of the considered partial discrete
   Fourier sums S-n,S-N ( f, x) as n = O(N-2/7), (N) = max(0 jN-1) t(j)
   More exactly, we have a two-sided pointwise estimate for the Lebesgue
   function L-n,L- N(x), depending on n and the position of the point x
   from {[}-1, 1].},

Abstract = {Employment of two independent approaches revealed that
   O-palmitoyl-L-malate does not penetrate through plasma membrane of
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells This substrate derivative completely
   inhibited yeast succinate respiration Linear behavior of the dependence
   of the respiration rate on inhibitor concentrations in Dixon plots
   suggests that plasmalemma transport is the rate limiting step for
   succinate oxidation and transport of this substrate involves a single
   type of transporter This rapid test is applicable at any changes of
   assay conditions Affinity of this transporter for succinate was
   evaluated using endogenous coupled mitochondrial succinate oxidase
   system of cells, which were grown under conditions favoring mitochondria
   proliferation At pH 6 5 the K(m) value for the plasmalemmal transporter
   was one order of magnitude higher then the K(m) value for mitochondrial
   dicarboxylate transporter determined using mitochondria preparations,
   whereas the activity of the plasmalemmal transporter was rather low
   Consequently, during succinate oxidation in yeasts the endogenous
   coupled system of cells maintains low concentration of this substrate in
   cytoplasm This is independent evidence that oxidation is limited by
   plasmalemmal transport},

Title = {DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES ON THE BASIS OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTTOM
   STATIONS IN DIFFERENT ZONES OF THE NORTH-CASPIAN SHELF},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {13-30},
Abstract = {Aim. On the basis of four experimental bottom stations installed at
   various depths of the North Caspian shelf, the local communities of
   marine organisms were formed, on various constructions and in close
   proximity to them were investigated. The aim of the work is to study the
   features of community development on the basis of bottom biological
   stations, to measure their quantitative characteristics, to assess the
   informative character of the structural and functional characteristics
   of local communities for analyzing the state of the marine environment.
   Methods. Experimental bottom stations were installed in various regions
   of the North Caspian shelf using diving equipment to study their impact
   on the environment. Control over the development of associated fauna was
   carried out with the help of traps and the method of direct accounting
   for the materials of photo-video surveys. Sampling of fouling was
   carried out by the method of registration sites. Based on the number of
   species of flora and fauna of local communities, a ballroom information
   system has been suggested, that can be used for monitoring. Results.
   Research materials indicate a significant difference in the species
   composition, biomass and the structure of communities of local cenoses
   formed at the bottom stations with the same design and ecological
   capacity at various depths of the North Caspian shelf. In the shallow
   shelf zone at depths of 6-8 m in the local community of the bottom
   station, the vegetation component is dominant. At great depths, the
   total biomass increases in local cenoses and animal communities,
   including filter-feeders, make significant contribution to the
   self-purification of the marine environment. Conclusions. The results
   indicate the possibility of using complex observations of the structure
   and functional characteristics of local communities formed on the base
   of bottom stations, as well as the development of species of indicators
   and objects of accumulation of toxicants for assessing the state of the
   marine environment. The development of this approach involves the
   experiments with different station costructioons and materials and use
   of biotechnology implantation of test organisms on the design of bottom
   stations.},

   The authors analyze the level and dynamics of development of regional
   economy of Russia and Europe, study dependence on import, determine its
   influence on indicators of development of regional economy of Russia and
   Europe, and prepare import substituting approach to development of
   regional economy of Russia and Europe. The main conclusion is that
   regional economy of Russia and Europe is insufficiently developed, the
   reason of this being its high dependence on import, which predetermines
   the necessity for activation of the process of import substitution.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the relationship of scientific and religious
   worldviews. It is shown that in different historical periods they took
   rather rigid forms. The historical development of these worldviews is
   analyzed. The specificity of scientific and religious worldviews is
   revealed. They considered the ways of scientific and religious worldview
   symbiosis and the conditions necessary for this. It is argued that in
   the modern era the dialogue between these worldviews becomes relevant,
   it is necessary to eliminate the conflicts between them.},

   of the specific heat c(p), thermal diffusivity alpha, and thermal
   conductivity lambda of polycrystalline CdSnAs2 with n-type conductivity.
   The possible mechanisms of thermal conductivity in the studied
   temperature range are analyzed. It is shown that the main mechanisms of
   heat transfer for polycrystalline n-CdSnAs2 are electronic, bipolar, and
   phonon. It is found that the phonon component of thermal conductivity,
   which is calculated as the difference between the total thermal
   conductivity and the electronic and bipolar components of thermal
   conductivity, decreases with temperature faster than according to the
   law lambda(p) similar to T-1.},

Abstract = {Wild waterfowl birds are known to be the main reservoir for a variety of
   avian influenza viruses of different subtypes. Some subtypes, such as
   H2Nx, H8Nx, H12Nx, and H14Nx, occur relatively rarely in nature. During
   10-year long-term surveillance, we isolated five rare H12N5 and one
   H12N2 viruses in three different distinct geographic regions of Northern
   Eurasia and studied their characteristics. H12N2 from the Far East
   region was a double reassortant containing hemagglutinin (HA),
   non-structural (NS) and nucleoprotein (NP) segments of the American
   lineage and others from the classical Eurasian avian-like lineage. H12N5
   viruses contain Eurasian lineage segments. We suggest a
   phylogeographical scheme for reassortment events associated with
   geographical groups of aquatic birds and their migration flyways. The
   H12N2 virus is of particular interest as this subtype has been found in
   common teal in the Russian Far East region, and it has a strong relation
   to North American avian influenza virus lineages, clearly showing that
   viral exchange of segments between the two continents does occur. Our
   results emphasize the importance of Avian Influenza Virus (AIV)
   surveillance in Northern Eurasia for the annual screening of virus
   characteristics, including the genetic constellation of rare virus
   subtypes, to understand the evolutionary ecology of AIV.},

   evaluation of effectiveness of the use of macro-level tools of
   overcoming the crises in socio-economic sphere of Russia and Europe with
   the help of the developed proprietary methodology and perform
   qualitative analysis of the use of macro-level tools of overcoming the
   crises in socio-economic sphere of Russia and Europe with the help of
   the developed proprietary methodology and perform qualitative analysis
   with the help of causal connections method. The authors determine
   perspective micro-level financial tools for joint overcoming of crises
   in socio-economic sphere in the context of Russian-European cooperation
   and prove that effectiveness of overcoming of consequences of crises in
   socio-economic sphere should is higher at the micro-level, as compared
   to macro-level tools.},

Abstract = {The duration of the vegetative period is an important agronomic
   characteristic of cereal crops. It is mainly influenced by the Vrn
   (response to vernalization) and Ppd (response to photoperiod) genes. In
   this work, we searched for alleles of several known genes of these two
   systems of response to external conditions in 15 accessions of Aegilops
   tauschii Coss. (syn. Ae. squarrosa L.), with the aim of studying the
   impact these alleles have on the vegetative period duration and growth
   habit. As a result, three allelic variants have been found for the
   Vrn-D1 gene: (i) one intact (winter type), (ii) one with a 5437 bp
   deletion in the first intron and (iii) one previously undescribed allele
   with a 3273 bp deletion in the first intron. It has been shown that the
   spring growth habit of Ae. tauschii can be developed due to the presence
   of a new allele of the Vrn-D1 gene. Significant differences in
   expression levels between the new allelic variant of the Vrn-D1 gene and
   the intact allele vrn-D1 were confirmed by qPCR. The new allele can be
   introgressed into common wheat to enhance the biodiversity of the spring
   growth habit and vegetative period duration of plants.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the article is to determine the place and role of
   budgeting in the system of methods of managerial accounting of
   contractual relationship of cluster. The research was conducted within
   the concept of institutional economy, concept of enterprise management,
   concept of financial management, and concept of clustering of economy.
   This determined the choice and use of the methodology of the research,
   based on the method of institutional, financial, problem, systemic, and
   structural \& functional analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction,
   formalization, and modeling of economic systems. The authors determined
   the specifics of management of contractual relationship of cluster,
   analyzed the system of methods of managerial accounting of contractual
   relationship of cluster, and determined problems and perspectives and
   developed recommendations for development of budgeting as a ley method
   of managerial accounting of contractual relationship of cluster. As a
   result, the authors came to the conclusion that budgeting occupies the
   central place and performs the key role in the system of methods of
   managerial accounting of contractual relationship of cluster.},

Abstract = {The ecological and biological aspects of the creation of a protective
   forest stands are considered. The results can serve as a basis for the
   development of measures for the rational use of land resources and the
   creation of protective forest plantations in arid conditions. An
   assessment of the introductory resources of dendroflora for the creation
   of protective forest stands is given, and the mycotrophy of species is
   studied for the first time in order to determine the possibilities of
   their use in protective forest stands. The criteria that determine the
   mycotrophy of woody plants and diagnostics of their resistance make it
   possible to assess the effectiveness of work on the introduction and
   reproduction of tree species and can also be used in the development of
   a general program for the restoration of natural forest phytocenoses.},

   The measurements were performed under normal conditions, based on
   P,V,T,x-data obtained in the temperature range of 300-680 K, pressures
   up to 60 MPa, and in a wide range of densities. Based on the

Abstract = {Comparative sequence analysis of symbiotic genes (nodA, nodC, nodD,
   nifH), which are elements of accessory component of the rhizobial
   genome, demonstrated that the strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv.
   viciae, isolated from the nodules of a relic legume, Vavilovia formosa,
   the closest relative of hypothetical common ancestor of the tribe
   Fabeae, represented a group separated from the strains of R.
   leguminosarum bv. viciae, isolated from other representatives of this
   tribe (Vicia, Lathyrus, Pisum, Lens). No isolation was observed relative
   to the genes representing the core component of the rhizobial genome
   (16S rDNA, ITS, glnII) or relative to host specificity of the rhizobia.
   The data obtained suggest that sequence divergence of symbiotic genes
   marks the initial stage of sympatric speciation, which can be classified
   as the isolation of the relic ``vaviloviae{''} symbiotype, a possible
   evolutionary precursor of the ``viciae{''} biotype.},

   modernization of the system of accounting of financial results of
   company's activities on the basis of new information and communication
   technologies (ICT). In order to determine the influence of accessibility
   and intensity of using new ICT on entrepreneurship, the method of
   regression analysis is used. The information and analytical basis for
   research includes the materials of the Global competitiveness report of
   the World Economic Forum for 2017-2018; the authors use for determining
   regression dependence between 6th pillar: Goods market efficiency, 11th
   pillar: Business sophistication, and 9th pillar: Technological
   readiness. It is substantiate that modernization of the system of
   accounting of financial results of a modern company's activities should
   be performed on the basis of new ICT. For this, the traditional
   approach, which envisages preservation of organizational \& managerial
   and production business processes of a company during transfer on
   business processes, related to preparation of corporate financial
   accounting, into electronic form, should be replaced by the innovational
   approach. The authors perform comparative analysis of the traditional
   and innovational approaches to modernization of the system of accounting
   of financial results of company's activities on the basis of new ICT and
   show advantages of the offered approach - simplification and
   acceleration of accounting of financial results of company's activities,
   increase of transparency and control over business processes, and
   reduction of the risk component of accounting of financial results of
   company's activities, and show the main problems that hinder its
   practical application.},

Abstract = {Aim: Search for an effective method for obtaining bacterial protein and
   determining the optimal concentration for identification of specific
   types.
   Material and Methods. Using the example of a C. xerosis N 1911 reference
   strain grown on a nutrient medium improved by us, methods were
   investigated of protein precipitation with sodium chloride, ammonium
   sulphate, sodium hexametaphosphate, trichloroacetic acid and
   polyethylene glycol. The threshold sensitivity of the allergen in six
   different cultures was determined in tests on 24 guinea pigs infected
   with corynebacteria. Biological activity was studied in cultures from 36
   guinea pigs infected with M. BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine), M.
   avium, C. xerosis N 1911, C. ulcerans N 675 and C. bovis, as well as 3
   rabbits infected with Corynebacterium xerosis.
   Results. Comparative testing of five protein precipitation methods was
   carried out. When using ammonium sulphate as a precipitant relatively
   high results were obtained at a salt concentration of 30\% and a pH of
   at least 5.8. More significant protein precipitation occurred at the
   isoelectric point of sodium chloride at pH 3.9. It was noted that
   trichioroacetic acid and sodium hexametaphosphate had insignificant
   precipitating properties while there was none with polyethylene glycol.
   The threshold sensitivity (0.00005 mg in 0.1 ml) and allergen unit of
   action (0.0003 mg) were established. Intensity of skin reaction to
   sensitin homologous to infection was detected.
   Conclusions. The data obtained revealed the optimal method of protein
   precipitation, the unit of action of the corynebacterium allergens, and
   expanded the understanding of the mechanisms of the sensitization of the
   macro-organism to tuberculin.},

Title = {Biological characteristics of influenza virus subtype H6N8 isolated from
   wild birds in the south of Western Siberia},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Aim. The aim is to explore the molecular and biological characteristics
   of influenza virus subtype H6N8.
   Material and Methods. Regular collecting of biological samples from wild
   birds was carried out in 2016 in the south of Western Siberia. Isolation
   of avian influenza virus strains from birds' cloacal swabs was performed
   using three passages in embryonated chicken eggs. Hemagglutination assay
   was used to detect viruses in the allantoic fluid. Type and subtype of
   influenza viruses were identified using reverse transcription PCR
   (RT-PCR).
   Results. This is the first time the avian influenza virus H6N8 subtype
   has been isolated in Russia. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that
   hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) segments of
   A/gadwall/Chany/97/2016(H6N8) strain genome belonged to the Eurasian
   lineages of avian influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that
   the HA sequence of the strain was closely related to the strain isolated
   from a duck in Bangladesh in 2015 (A/duck/Bangladesh/25767/2015(H6N1).
   Conclusion. Avian influenza viruses subtype H6N8 have the ability to
   circulate among wild waterfowl and poultry, increasing the chance of
   reassortment and transmission of H6 virus strains among birds. For this
   reason, it is of crucial importance to strengthen surveillance for avian
   influenza H6 subtype among wild birds in the south of Western Siberia.},

Title = {Incorporation of latitude-adjusted bioclimatic variables increases
   accuracy in species distribution models},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {469},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Latitudinal variations in species niche due to factors such as
   phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation pose fundamental problems for
   ecological niche modelling at large geographic scales. Species
   adaptation to varying climates across latitudes thus necessitates the
   latitudinal adjustment of climatic variables for incorporation into more
   accurate models of habitat suitability and species distribution.
   Previous studies have identified changes in species' elevational
   distributions across latitudes, however few studies incorporate
   latitude-adjusted variables into suitability or distribution models. In
   this study, we utilized generalized additive models (GAMs) to adjust
   bioclimatic variables by latitude in order to remove latitudinal
   variation in ecological niche models. We incorporated these
   latitude-adjusted variables into maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models of two
   species of toad, Bufo sachalinensis (previously Bufo gargarizans) and
   Bufo stejnegeri, in northeast Asia. We additionally identified
   thresholds in bioclimatic and terrain variables that delineate
   boundaries between the two Bufo species where their ranges overlap. We
   found that GAM adjustment of bioclimatic variables effectively removed
   latitudinal variation in said variables. MaxEnt models incorporating
   these latitude-adjusted variables had significantly improved model fit
   (AUC and TSS) for both Bufo species. We identified a potential sympatric
   area shared by the two species and delineated a geographic boundary
   thresholding the probable presence of one species over the other. This
   study shows a clear improvement for distribution models with the
   inclusion of latitude-adjusted bioclimatic variables for both narrow and
   wide-ranging species. This has implications for future distribution
   modelling practices, especially for geographically widespread species,
   and has potential for modelling species distributions in climate change
   scenarios. Further, the methodology for delimiting species thresholds
   has future use in modelling contact zones of related species.},

Abstract = {This article provides an assessment and analysis of the formation of the
   international securities market since, in modern conditions, the
   international stock market (as a system of institutions and relations)
   refers to that part of the international financial securities market
   where transactions with such foreign stock assets as stocks, bonds and
   financial derivatives, are carried out and there is an international
   transfer of financial claims and liabilities between the asset owner,
   their companies and debtors. Being a small part of the international
   financial market at its initial stage, it then expanded significantly
   and has now become one of its main components. The authors conclude that
   the international securities market is characterized by many constant
   foreign exchange transfers and depends on changing exchange rates.},

   temperatures (300-800 K). The potential mechanisms of heat transport are
   analyzed. The total thermal conductivity of the examined compounds in
   the studied temperature range is completely determined by the thermal
   conductivity of the crystal lattice lambda(lat). It is demonstrated that
   the thermal conductivity of the crystal lattice changes with temperature
   faster than with lambda(lat) similar to T-1. The potential causes of the
   deviation of the thermal conductivity of the crystal lattice from the
   Eucken law are considered.},

Title = {A revision of the Palaearctic Pimeliini (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae): a
   comparative analysis and systematic position of Eastern European and
   Asian taxa with dorso-lateral eyes},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {809},
Pages = {1-71},
Month = {APR 5},
Abstract = {A taxonomic review of tenebrionid platyopoid genera of the subfamily
   Pimeliinae from Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Afghanistan, Iran and
   Pakistan is given. This group of taxa was known before 1994 as the tribe
   Platyopini Motschulsky, 1849, which is now interpreted as a junior
   synonym of Pimeliini Latreille, 1802. The group is different from other
   Pimeliini in having dorso-lateral eyes, located above the level of the
   genae, and it includes the following ultrapsammophilic genera at least
   from Central and Southern Asia: Apatopsis Semenov, 1891, Habrochiton
   Semenov-Tjan-Shansky, 1907, Habrobates Semenov, 1903 {[}= Kawiria
   Schuster, 1935 syn. nov.], Dietomorpha Reymond, 1938, Przewalskia
   Semenov, 1893, Mantichorula Reitter, 1889, Platyope Fischer von
   Waldheim, 1820 {[}= Homopsis Semenov, 1893 syn. nov.], Earophanta
   Semenov, 1903. These genera are distributed in almost all large deserts
   of Palaearctic Asia: Karakum, Kyzylkum, Muyunkum, Taklamakan, Gobi,
   Registan, Dasht-e-Kawir, Dasht-e-Lut, as well as in other arid and
   semi-arid sandy landscapes from European Russia to the south of Eastern
   Siberia. The group of platyopoid genera is polyphyletic. We propose at
   least two monophyletic branches: the Habrobates genus group (the first
   four genera mentioned above), which represents the subtribe Habrobatina
   Nabozhenko \& S. Chigray subtrib. nov. and the Platyope genus group
   (latter four genera) within the nominotypical subtribe. A new species is
   described from Pakistan (Balochistan): Dietomorpha gonzalesi S. Chigray
   \& Nabozhenko sp. nov. Platyope granulata Fischer von Waldheim, 1820 is
   recorded for Kazakhstan for the first time. The following synonymy is
   resurrected: Apatopsis grombczewskii Semenov, 1890 = Apatopsis conradti
   Semenov, 1890, syn. resurr. Two new combinations resulting from the
   synonymy of genera are given: Habrobates gabrieli Schuster, 1935 comb.
   nov. (from Kawiria), Platyope grumi Semenov, 1893 comb. nov. (from
   Homopsis). Lectotypes are designated for the following taxa: Apatopsis
   grombczewskii (Semenov, 1891), Apatopsis conradti Semenov, 1891,
   Habrochiton vernus Semenov-Tjan-Shansky, 1907, Habrobates vernalis
   Semenov, 1903, Kawiria gabrieli Schuster, 1935, Platyope dilatata
   Reitter, 1887; Mantichorula semenowi Reitter, 1889, Mantichorula grandis
   Semenov, 1893, Homopsis grumi Semenov, 1893, Platyope serrata Semenov,
   1893, Platyope planidorsis Reitter, 1889, Platyope tomentosa Semenov,
   1893. Additional information for type specimens studied by the authors
   is given for Habrochiton primaeveris Semenov-Tjan-Shansky, 1907
   (holotype), Habrobates vejisovi Kelejnikova, 1977, Platyope ordossica
   Semenov-Tjan-Shansky, 1907 (holotype), Earophanta autumnalis Semenov,
   1903 (holotype, junior synonym of E. planidorsis Reitter, 1889),
   Earophanta loudoni Semenov, 1903 (holotype, junior synonym of Earophanta

Title = {Assessment of changes in the normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) of farmlands of Stavropol Territory, Russia, during the period of
   active vegetation in 2020 based on medium spatial resolution images},

Abstract = {Aim. Assess changes in the NDVI of agricultural land in Stavropol
   Territory under the influence of weather and climate conditions.
   Methods. Based on earth remote sensing data, the spectral/vegetation
   index NDVI was calculated. We used data from the Meteor-M satellite with
   a spatial resolution of 60 m for the active vegetation period of 2020
   (May to September), which made it possible to calculate the NDVI value
   at different times of the active vegetation period of the main types of
   agricultural land in the Stavropol Territory. To explain the spatial and
   temporal variability of NDVI, an analysis of the conditions of heat and
   moisture supply was carried out using Walter's climatograms at weather
   stations located in the steppe and semi-desert landscapes of Stavropol
   Territory.Results. In 2020, the period of active vegetation in the
   steppe and semi desert landscapes of Stavropol Territory began in the
   first ten days of April, when the air temperature rose above +10 \&
   DEG;C, and ended in mid-October. In accordance with the change in heat
   and moisture supply, the NDVI value changed: in general, maximum values
   were observed in spring and early summer and, as aridity increased, the
   areas corresponding to low NDVI values increased everywhere. In the
   steppe zone, where the main crops of winter wheat are located, the NDVI
   value decreased from 0.45-0.3 at the beginning of the active vegetation
   period to 0.15 at the end. NDVI values of 0.15-0.30, corresponding to
   different types of herbaceous vegetation, prevailed at the end of the
   active vegetation period.Conclusion. The spatial and temporal
   distribution of the NDVI value over the territory of the Stavropol
   Territory reflects, first of all, changes in the conditions of heat and
   moisture supply. The timing of the course of the phenological phases of
   natural and cultivated vegetation depends on the latter. 2020 was
   characterized by sufficient moisture at the beginning of active
   vegetation, as reflected in the high density of seedlings, and,
   accordingly, a large area of NDVI, corresponding not only to herbaceous,
   but also to shrubby vegetation within the steppe landscapes. The
   increase in moisture deficit and harvesting in the second half and end
   of summer leveled the differences between the steppe and semi-desert
   landscapes, since the maximum areas were occupied by territories with
   NDVI values of 0.15-0.3.},

Title = {Instrumental assessment of the formation of the elemental composition of
   wines with various bentonite clays},
Journal = {MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {175},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The work is devoted to the study of the influence of clarification and
   stabilization of wines with bentonite clays (BT) on their elemental
   composition, which determines their varietal differences. Raw wine
   samples produced from grape varieties Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and
   Moldova in the Krasnodar Territory were clarified and stabilized with 32
   BT samples of various degrees of dispersion and trademarks. The ICP-OES
   and ICP-MS methods were used to quantify 39 elements in 96 treated and 3
   untreated wine samples, as well as BT samples. To establish possible
   mechanisms of metal exchange in the studied samples, a qualitative and
   quantitative phase analysis of the components was carried out, according
   to which BT were divided into four groups. The wine samples treated with
   BT of various groups had a different chemical composition, which
   differed from the initial ones in the concentration of almost all the
   determined elements. At the stabilization and clarification stages of
   wines with BT samples, a violation of the relationship between the
   elemental composition of wine, grapes and soil was observed. It was
   noted that when identifying marker elements determining the varietal
   affiliation of wine, it is necessary to take into account the
   contribution of BT to the formation of its elemental composition.
   Considering the contents of 16 isolated metals in the treated wine
   samples, the presence of cluster structures was established by the
   discriminant analysis and principal component analysis, indicating the
   preservation of intervarietal differences and intravarietal similarity
   after treatment with BT. BT did not change the varietal identity of
   wines, but influenced their elemental composition.},

Abstract = {The morphological and functional characteristics of the somatic
   musculature's histological structure have been studied for three species
   of deep-sea fish from the Myctophidae family: spotted lanternfish
   Myctophum punctatum, lancet fish Notoscopelus kroyeri, and rakery
   beaconlamp Lampanyctus macdonaldi. The average diameter of fast-twitch
   and slow-twitch muscle fibers in all studied species is large, and this
   indicator is highest in rakery beaconlamp. All species are characterized
   by a craniocaudal gradient of a decrease in the size of white muscle
   fibers. The shape of the fibers, from angular polygonal (spotted
   lanternfish) to the oval (rakery beaconlamp) and round (lancet fish), is
   a distinctive feature from other species of bony fish. In spotted
   lanternfish, a group of fibers of very small diameter, which are
   presumably small, slow-twitch oxidizing fibers, was also noted between
   the white and red muscles. The red muscles in the studied fish are
   poorly identified, since they are poorly developed. The studied species
   have a well-developed connective tissue carcass of white muscles, which
   indicates a certain friability of fast-twitch muscles. Both the red and
   white muscles in lanternfishes are a place of intense deposition of
   lipid reserves. Apparently, the high lipid content in muscle tissue
   helps to reduce the specific gravity of fish and increase their
   buoyancy.},

Abstract = {The age- and role-related growth of young school-age children is made
   possible by psychophysiological processes, among them gender role
   behaviour. Our research makes it possible to define the correlative link
   between creativity and lateralisation, which affects the motivation of
   boys and girls differently. Art therapy with girls showed a very strong
   prediliction towards independence and risk-taking against a background
   of middling self-sufficiency. Work with boys demonstrated a negative
   tendency for dependence on the opinions of others against a background
   of heightened hopes of success. Participants reacted strongly to the
   requirement to display the results of their creative art therapy work,
   and were generally apprehensive of the reaction of others to, and the
   social validation of, what they had done. This research shows the need
   to either segregate boys and girls into different groups or set separate
   tasks for each sex, thus reducing competition. The former experience
   positive changes in the strength and lability of the nervous system, as
   well as improved sensitivity.},

   structure and seasonal changes in group structure of argali Ovis ammon
   karelini Severtzov, 1873 in the Tian-Shan of Kyrgyzstan. The study was
   carried out within two adjoining areas: the Baralbas River region, and
   the Ak-Tash River region. Data were collected during three seasons:
   winter, spring and summer. This population consisted of 42.3\% females,
   22.2\% males, 13.4\% yearlings, and 22.1\% lambs. Composition and
   numbers of groups were seasonally changing. Argali occurred
   predominantly in mixed groups during winter and exclusively in separated
   groups during summer. The maximum group size decreased from 25\% from
   winter to spring, however, increased during summer.},

Abstract = {Aim. The aim is to study the technological processes of obtaining Bester
   caviar in the unconventional autumn-winter period. Methods. Extraction
   of caviar was carried out antemortem by the pillow method cutting the
   oviducts. The scheme of gonadotropic stimulation for all Bester females
   was the same: preliminary surfagon injection at the rate of 0.5 mkg/kg,
   while an acceptable dose of injection is 2.5 mkg per kilogram of fish
   weight. The object of the research was the female bester (Acipenser
   nikoljukini) grown in ponds at the age of 12-13 years with the
   polarization rate of 7-9, the caviar of which was extracted for the
   third time. The mass of fish and the yield of eggs were determined by
   the method of Pravdina I.F. The studies were performed in 4 experimental
   and 1 control variants. Results. We studied the possibility of
   extracting the caviar of the Bester females (Acipenser nikoljukini)
   inhabiting the ponds at the natural water temperature in the
   unconventional autumn-winter period. It is shown that the hybrid form of
   sturgeon fishes, here, the female bester, can spawn without gradual
   withdrawal to spawning temperature regime and without prior exposure in
   these conditions in contrast to the recommendations adopted in sturgeon
   breeding. Conclusion. We established the possibility of obtaining and
   producing fresh caviar of sturgeon fishes, especially when the demand
   increases during the pre-New Year holidays.},

Title = {The Role of Recent Admixture in Forming the Contemporary West Eurasian

Abstract = {Over the past few years, studies of DNA isolated from human fossils and
   archaeological remains have generated considerable novel insight into
   the history of our species. Several landmark papers have described the
   genomes of ancient humans across West Eurasia, demonstrating the
   presence of large-scale, dynamic population movements over the last
   10,000 years, such that ancestry across present-day populations is
   likely to be a mixture of several ancient groups {[}1-7]. While these
   efforts are bringing the details of West Eurasian prehistory into
   increasing focus, studies aimed at understanding the processes behind
   the generation of the current West Eurasian genetic landscape have been
   limited by the number of populations sampled or have been either too
   regional or global in their outlook {[}8-11]. Here, using recently
   described haplotype-based techniques {[}11], we present the results of a
   systematic survey of recent admixture history across Western Eurasia and
   show that admixture is a universal property across almost all groups.
   Admixture in all regions except North Western Europe involved the influx
   of genetic material from outside of West Eurasia, which we date to
   specific time periods. Within Northern, Western, and Central Europe,
   admixture tended to occur between local groups during the period 300 to
   1200 CE. Comparisons of the genetic profiles of West Eurasians before
   and after admixture show that population movements within the last 1,500
   years are likely to have maintained differentiation among groups. Our
   analysis provides a timeline of the gene flow events that have generated
   the contemporary genetic landscape of West Eurasia.},

Abstract = {The modern Russian regional society is multicultural and bilingual
   (multilingual) to make difficulties for mutual contacts of multilingual
   peoples. The problem of overcoming language barriers in a multi-ethnic
   regional community is in want of state support and special legal
   regulation. One of the best ways to solve this problem is bilingualism.
   Bilingualism is the possession of two languages - mother language and
   nationwide language (the so-called intermediary language). The choice of
   the language-mediator is determined by the socio-political,
   socio-historical and socio-economic conditions of life of a particular
   ethno-lingual education. The Russian language is the state language of
   the Russian society. The representatives of different nationalities
   enter into language contacts with each other through the Russian
   language. The Russian language serves as an intermediate language in the
   conditions of a multinational state. However, the uniqueness of any
   ethnic formation is manifested through language. Therefore the
   development of guarantees of linguistic rights is actually. Further we
   should be solving a bilingualism problem at the level of laws on
   languages adopted in the republics that make up the Russian Federation.},

Abstract = {This study examined educational challenges related to teaching online at
   universities that have surfaced during the COVID-19 outbreak. The
   authors explicate the main issues pertaining to online teaching and
   learning in general and foreign languages teaching in particular. The
   article sets out to address the following challenges for educators using
   information and communication technology: handling a wide variety of
   online learning platforms and learning apps, adapting courses to a fully
   online environment and increasing students' engagement. Finally, the
   article identifies strategies and techniques for reducing or eliminating
   these issues for students and academic staff. The objectives set have
   been achieved by means of general methods of scientific knowledge
   (observation, analysis and synthesis) and reflective methods. The
   authors conclude that there should be a strong emphasis on a
   comprehensive approach to support students and academic staff in online
   learning environment. The results and implications of this study are
   critical for educators developing and delivering online language

Abstract = {During a 2-year period in 2005-2007, we conducted surveillance of group
   A rotaviruses and other enteric agents among patients hospitalized with
   acute gastroenteritis in 8 different cities of the Russian Federation.
   Fecal specimens were gathered from 3208 children (including 2848
   children aged <5 years) and 1354 adults who were admitted to hospitals
   in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Chelyabinsk, Nizhnii Novgorod, Tyumen,
   Khabarovsk, Makhachkala, and Yakutsk. Polymerase chain reaction was
   performed to detect rotaviruses of groups A and C, noroviruses of
   genogroups I and II, astrovirus, sapovirus, and enteric adenoviruses
   (group F). Group A rotavirus was the most common viral pathogen detected
   among children aged <5 years (43.6\%), followed by norovirus (12.5\%),
   whereas norovirus was the pathogen most commonly detected in adults
   (11.9\%). P and G genotypes were determined for 515 rotavirus specimens,
   and the most prevalent genotypes were G1P{[}8] (44.9\%), G4P{[}8]
   (40.0\%), G2P{[}4] (8.5\%), and G3P{[}8] (6.6\%). This study is the
   first multicenter study of rotaviruses in the Russian Federation and
   documents the important burden of disease caused by this pathogen, which
   soon may be preventable by vaccination.},

Abstract = {The aim of this work is to develop a new effective technology for
   producing high-quality lithium carbonate from natural lithium-containing
   brines. Freshly deposited aluminum hydroxide was used to separate
   lithium from the trace amounts of sodium and calcium. It was found that
   the completeness of lithium extraction from brines purified from
   magnesium depends on the sorbent dosage, phase contact time,
   mineralization, pH, and brine temperature. To extract lithium from
   brines with a mineralization of less than 100 g/dm(3), it is necessary
   to introduce 4 mol of aluminum hydroxide per 1 mol of lithium in the
   brine For brines with a mineralization greater than 200 g/dm(3), the
   consumption of the sorbent providing the extraction of lithium more than
   96\% is 2.5 mol of aluminum hydroxide. Desorption of lithium chloride
   from lithium-aluminum concentrate is carried out by processing 4-5
   canopies of concentrate in a Soxlet type apparatus with the same volume
   of distilled water. The resulting concentrated solution of lithium
   chloride is purified from calcium impurities in contact with a saturated
   solution of lithium carbonate. From a heated aqueous solution of lithium
   chloride purified from calcium impurities, lithium carbonate is
   precipitated by dosing a stoichiometric amount of a saturated solution
   of sodium carbonate into it. The precipitate of lithium carbonate is
   separated from the mother solution, washed with three portions of a
   saturated solution of lithium carbonate at a ratio of solid to liquid by
   weight equal to one to five, in order of decreasing the concentration of
   sodium in each portion of the wash water. The dried product contains at
   least 99.6\% Li2CO3.},

Abstract = {The results of hematological, cytochemical, and biochemical surveys for
   fish blood in the specimen Ocellate river stingray Potamotrygon motoro
   and two specimens of cat sharks including the Halmahera epaulette shark
   Hemiscyllium halmahera and the grey bambooshark Chiloscyllium griseumare
   have been reported. A comparison in the parameters analyzed in the
   survey between the common carp Cyprinus carpio, the wels catfish Silurus
   glanis, and the sterlet Acipenser ruthenus has been performed. A high
   percentage of eosinophils involved in antiparasite immunity in the
   Cartilaginous fishes is recorded. A high content of cationic protein in
   lysosomes of neutrophils in these fish species can indicate a
   considerable potent phagocytic activity of the latter. A low amount of
   alanine aminotransferase in the analyzed shark and ray specimens
   compared to the bony fish was recorded, which indicate the strength of
   membranes in hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes.},

Abstract = {Chlorophanus vittatus Schoenherr, 1832, known from the Caucasus and
   northern Iran, is here newly reported from eastern Turkey. Salix L.,
   Populus L., Tamarix L. and Glycyrrhiza glabra L. are revealed as host
   plants of adults in Turkey. Feeding and mating behavior of adults were
   observed on leaves of G. glabra during the summer period in the Aras
   River valley. The lectotype of Ch. vittatus is designated, description
   and digital photographs of the genitalia are presented based on newly
   collected material. Distributional data for Ch. vittatus , Ch. excisus
   (Fabricius, 1801) and Ch. pollinosus (Fabricius, 1792) in Turkey are
   reported, the latter species is also recorded from Turkey for the first
   time. Chlorophanus flavescens (Fabricius, 1787) is deleted from the list
   of the Iranian fauna, and Ch . excisus , from the list of the Russian
   fauna. Characteristic ecological and distributional features of the
   genus Chlorophanus C. R. Sahlberg, 1823 are discussed, and notes on the
   riparian habitats in Turkey are given to attract attention to the
   necessity of their preservation. As a fragile member of the riparian
   insect species complex, a weevil, Corimalia aliena (Faust, 1890),
   formerly known only from Central Palaearctic, is reported for the first
   time from Turkey where it was found on Myricaria sp. in Erzurum
   Province. Chlorophanus excisus co-occurs with Ch. vittatus in eastern
   Turkey and western Iran, or at least their ranges overlap there. These
   two species contribute to the maximum local Chlorophanus diversity in
   Erzincan and Erzurum provinces. Chlorophanus micans is recorded in
   Crimean Mountains and Southern Bug River valley indicating a potential
   current contact between Ch. micans and Ch. pollinosus in Podolian
   Upland.},

Abstract = {The paper provides the first data about age structure and growth of the
   Zamda toad, Bufotes zamdaensis (Boulenger, 1882), from the Himachal
   Pradesh State (India). The study of age structure of toads was carried
   out using skeletochronology. The minimal and maximal ages in males of B.
   zamdaensis were 4 and 7 years, respectively, with mean age of 5.4 years.
   The majority of males (60\%) were 5 years old. The age in females ranged
   from 5 to 9 years with mean value of 6.1 years. The majority of females
   (71\%) were 5 - 6 years old. Males of B. zamdaensis can reach maturation

Abstract = {The article argues the dependence of the size of informal business
   activities on the level of the tax culture of society, identifies the
   shortcomings of the implementation of the state policy of the country in
   terms of preventing tax offenses. It is noted that the concept of ``tax
   culture{''} has so far been understood by researchers and practitioners
   ambiguously, it also has no strict scientific definition. In this
   regard, the author's interpretation of the essence of the tax culture of
   society is proposed and a set of tools for coordinating the efforts of
   the state, business structures and the population in the formation of
   this complex multi-level system is determined.},

Abstract = {The paper provided the first data about age structure and growth of the
   Lataste's toad, Bufotes latastii (Boulenger, 1882), from the Jammu and
   Kashmir State (India). The study of age structure of toads was carried
   out using skeletochronology. The minimal and maximal ages in males of B.
   latastii were 3 and 10 years, respectively, with mean age of 6.0 years.
   The majority of males (70\%) were 5 or 6 years old. The age in females
   ranged from 4 to 10 years with mean value of 5.9 years. The majority of
   females (71\%) were 4 - 6 years old. Males of B. latastii can reach
   maturation after three winterings and females after four winterings. The
   body length increment in males is 3.6 times, whereas in females is 3.7 -
   4.0 times. After maturation, the growth rate is retarded and the
   individuals of different ages did not differ in its body length. In
   spite of maximal age of 10 years in both sexes, the largest male was 5
   years old and the largest female was 4 years old.},

Abstract = {The aim of the work was to compare the psychological characteristics
   obtained using the Hands Test in representatives of various ethnic
   groups living in the South of Russia. We used the Wagner Hand Test. The
   study was carried out on respondents aged 15-16 and 17-30 years old,
   living in the Rostov region, the republics of Karachay-Cherkessia,
   Kabardino-Balkaria, Crimea, Adygea. The total number of respondents was
   689, of which 304 were men and 385 were women. As a result, data were
   obtained on sex differences in psychological characteristics identified
   using the hand test. Women were found to be more Affective than men. The
   age-related characteristics of the hand test indicators were also
   revealed in the groups of 15-16 years old and 17-30 years old.
   Comparison of age subgroups 15-16 and 17-30 years old showed that with
   age there is an increase in the severity of psychological traits of
   Direction, Communication, Active, the degree of personal Maladjustive
   and the sum of indicators of Aggressive and Direction, as well as the
   sum of indicators of Affection, Communication and Dependence. The
   manifestations of psychological characteristics are also determined by
   ethnicity, in particular, in terms of such indicators as Direction, the
   sum of indicators of Aggressive and Direction, the indicator of
   Activity, the total number of answers on the test and the total
   indicator of Aggressive.},

Abstract = {The paper presents the study which examines the modern trends in
   academic mobility in Russia, as well as in other countries, namely the
   growing popularity of short-term language courses abroad. It addresses
   short-term language courses abroad in the framework of the academic
   mobility program, with its practical part being developed and
   implemented at Novosibirsk State Pedagogical University. The impact of
   short-term language programs on the development of language competences
   is evaluated from students' perspective. According to the presented data
   the university level students believe that participation in academic
   mobility program, realized via short-term courses, changes their
   attitude towards the target foreign language and culture from neutral to
   more positive, and has a positive impact on the development of their
   language competences. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Phylogeny and biogeography of the Pleistocene Holarctic steppe and
   semi-desert goosefoot plant <i>Krascheninnikovia ceratoides</i>},

Abstract = {Krascheninnikovia ceratoides (Chenopodiaceae) is a steppe and
   semi-desert plant with two subspecies, K. ceratoides subsp. ceratoides,
   which is widespread in Eurasia, and K. ceratoides subsp. lanata, which
   grows in western and central North America. A few disjunct populations
   of K. ceratoides subsp. ceratoides are found in Anatolia, Europe and
   North Africa to the west of its otherwise continuous Eurasian
   distribution. To understand the evolutionary history of this
   characteristic steppe and semi-desert plant, we analysed its phylogeny
   and biogeography. We sequenced several loci including ITS, ETS and the
   chloroplast intergenic spacer regions atpB-rbcL, rpl32-tra and trnL-trnF
   to establish a time-calibrated phylogeny and reconstruct intraspecific
   relationships. Furthermore, we identified the ploidy level of
   individuals. While diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid individuals have
   been reported in the literature, we were only able to find diploids and
   tetraploids. The diploids were found in the east of Mongolia,
   Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and the USA. The tetraploids were located
   in the west of Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Russia, and Europe.
   Populations were uniformly di- or tetraploid. Our results indicate that
   the species may have spread from the area of Mongolia, northern China
   and Middle Asia (i.e., the Altai Mountains region) in two opposite
   directions - on the one hand, diploids migrated to the east, to eastern
   Asia and North America, and on the other hand diploids and tetraploids
   migrated to the west, to western Asia and Europe. Fossil-calibrated gene
   trees were used to estimate the age of the species. Diversification
   within the species is probably of Pleistocene age. Our dated analysis
   indicates that the first split among extant lineages of the species took
   place in the Early Pleistocene (Gelasian). The spread of the main
   lineages is likely related to major phases of steppe and semi-desert
   expansions during glacial periods of the Pleistocene.},

Abstract = {The hematological and cytochemical parameters of the peripheral blood of
   the spotted barracudina Arctozenus risso and the sharpchin barracudina
   Paralepis coregonoides (Paralepididae) are studied for the first time
   from the materials of a survey in the Irminger Sea in 2018. It was shown
   that erythropoiesis in both fish species studied is approximately the
   same. Normoblasts and erythrocytes are present. The lymphoid character
   of the blood of both fish species was established by comparative
   analysis of leukograms. It was noted that a large proportion of mature
   segmented forms, i.e., neutrophils responsible for noncongenital
   nonspecific cellular immunity, is characteristic of sharpchin
   barracudina.},

Abstract = {The article presents the results of the study of priorities in the field
   of labor motivation of young agricultural scientists. A review of
   publications on labor motivation shows that important areas of research
   are the definition of priorities among internal and external motives and
   their study in segmentation by age and spheres of activity. Therefore,
   the determination of the priorities of labor motivation of young
   agricultural scientists is of great scientific and practical interest.
   We studied the motives of effective research and teaching activities of
   young employees on the example of a sociological survey conducted on the
   basis of Stavropol State Agrarian University. Using SPSS Statistics
   (version 21) software package and a unique mathematical apparatus, the
   priorities of labor motivation of young agricultural scientists were
   established. From the point of view of theoretical significance, the
   presented materials make it possible to use the research algorithm in
   such situations. The practical significance of the research results lies
   in the formation of an information base for strategic management of
   personnel processes in organizations of agricultural education.},

Abstract = {The Russian Federation is a country with significant inter-regional
   economic differentiation. the main macroeconomic indicators of developed
   regions-leaders and lagging regions-that determine the level and quality
   of life of the population differ tenfold. Managing changes in the
   functioning of lagging regions by creating a basis for their
   self-sustaining development, building competitive competencies, and
   digitalization can be an effective way to equalize territorial
   disparities. The purpose of the study is to reveal the specifics of the
   functioning of lagging Russian regions, systematize the problems of
   their functioning and determine the directions of their future
   self-sustaining development. Methods used in the study: economic and
   statistical analysis, grouping method, logical, induction and deduction,
   comparative-historical. The information base of the research is official
   materials and reports of the Federal state statistics service of the
   Russian Federation, analytical data and expert reports of Bankstoday,
   Fincan, Expert RA and the Analytical center under the government of the
   Russian Federation. Research result. Identification of lagging regions
   was made. for this purpose, the method of calculating the index of the
   current level of economic health of the region and its dynamics was
   applied. The key problems of lagging regions of Russia are systematized:
   budget restrictions; investment problems; employment problems, reduction
   of income of the population and reduction of quality of life. It is
   proved that the existing problems of lagging regions are reference
   points for their future self-sustaining development. It is determined
   that an effective way to equalize territorial disparities can be to
   manage changes in the functioning of lagging regions through the
   formation of a basis for their self-sustaining development, as well as
   building competitive competencies and digitalization.},

Abstract = {Years of research of the subtribe Blaptina made it possible to clarify
   relations between some species and propose changes in supraspecific
   structure of this subtribe. Blaps scabiosa Baudi di Selve, 1874 is
   designated as a type species of Caraboblaps Bauer, 1921, the new
   synonymy is proposed: Blaps Fabricius, 1775 = Caraboblaps Bauer, 1921,
   syn. n. Blaps nitens nitens Laporte, 1840 is designated as a type
   species of Periblaps Bauer, 1921, Blaps ominosa Menetries, 1832 is
   designated as a type species of Holoblaps Bauer, 1921; type species of
   Periblaps and Holoblaps are transferred here to genus Lithoblaps, as a
   result the following new synonymy is proposed: Lithoblaps Motschulsky,
   1860 = Periblaps Bauer, 1921, syn. n. = Holoblaps Bauer, 1921, syn. n.
   The similarity of the structure of the aedeagus of Ablapsis compressipes
   Reitter, 1887 and some species of the subgenus Prosoblapsia Skopin et
   Kaszab, 1978 (genus Blaps Fabricius, 1775) gives a base to transfer the
   taxon Ablapsis Reitter, 1887 into the genus Blaps as a separate subgenus
   (Ablapsis stat. resurr.). Blaps tentyrioides Seidlitz, 1893 (= Blaps
   socia Seidlitz, 1893) is designated as a type species of the subgenus
   Protoblaps Bauer, 1921. As the genera Protoblaps Bauer, 1921 and
   Genoblaps Bauer, 1921 have one type species and the aedeagal structure
   of type species of Ablapsis, Protoblaps and Prosoblapsia is similar, the
   new synonymy is proposed: Ablapsis Reitter, 1887 = Protoblaps Bauer,
   1921 syn. n. = Genoblaps Bauer, 1921 syn. n. = Prosoblapsia Skopin et
   Kaszab, 1978, syn. n. Analysis of imaginal and larval structures of the
   species here united in the taxon Lithoblaps Motschulsky, 1860 and other
   members of Blaps showed that differences between these two groups are
   comparable with those between other genera of the subtribe and,
   therefore, the former taxon is here regarded as a distinct genus
   Lithoblaps gen. resurr. Thus, 100 species and subspecies (marked as
   comb. n. or comb. resurr.) are transferred from Blaps to Lithoblaps. The
   additional new combination is established: Dila platythorax (Gemminger,
   1870), comb. n. (from Blaps). The key to genera and the catalogue of the
   subtribe Blaptina are given.},

Title = {AGE STRUCTURE AND GROWTH RATE OF THE TRIPLOID BATURA TOAD,<i>

Abstract = {The paper reports the results of the first skeletochronological study of
   age structure and distinguishing characteris-tics of growth in the
   triploid toad Bufotes baturae, inhabitant of Sasyk-Bulak hot spring in
   the Pamir Mountains (3797 m a.s.l.). Minimal and maximum ages of males
   of the species were three and seven years, respectively. The age of
   females ranged from three to six years. Mean age for both sexes was 4.0
   years. The majority of males (46.2\%) were three years old, most females
   (58.8\%) were four years old. The age of sexual maturity was reached
   after three hibernations (46\% in males and 24\% in females). The
   majority of toads breed once at the age of three or four years. Only few
   (18\% in females and 23\% in males) individuals in this population were
   older. Harsh high-alti-tude cold desert conditions and limited food
   resources may cause high mortality of the toads. The correlation
   be-tween the minimal age at sexual maturity and the degree of dryness of
   climate was demonstrated among species of the genus Bufotes. As a rule,
   toads which live in more humid climatic conditions mature earlier.
   Perhaps, this ex-plains that substantial part of semi-aquatic
   individuals of B. baturae in the hot spring mature at earlier age (3
   years) than other polyploid species (4 - 5 years) that inhabit arid
   environments. In both sexes of B. baturae, growth rate was similar to
   that of other closely related high-mountain species, diploid B. latastii
   and triploid B. pseudoraddei.},

Abstract = {Materials of the histostructure and clinical parameters of the blood of
   sexually mature females and males of the beaked redfish (Sebastes
   mentella) from the pelagial zone of the Irminger Sea (northeastern
   Atlantic) made it possible for the first time to describe the features
   of the morphological structure of the body and present the
   characteristics of blood cells. The diameter of white and red muscle
   fibers along the body (from head to tail) in females and males of the
   beaked redfish differs significantly. In addition, females differ from
   males in the distribution of the fiber density along the body. The
   morphology and size of erythropoietic cells and leukocytes in beaked
   females and males are similar to those of other fish species.
   Nevertheless, erythropoiesis and leukopoiesis of males and females
   proceed differently. Significant differences in the composition of the
   somatic muscles of females and males indicate a higher rate of metabolic
   processes in females. In the leukogram of females, the proportion of
   mature segmented neutrophils, which are the main microphages with high
   antigenic activity, is significantly higher than in males. Therefore,
   females have a higher cellular factor of innate immunity.},

Abstract = {In recent years many cases of hybridization and introgression became
   known for chelonians, requiring a better understanding of their
   speciation mechanisms. Phylogeographic investigations offer basic data
   for this challenge. We use the sister species Mauremys caspica and M.
   rivulata, the most abundant terrapins in the Near and Middle East and
   South-east Europe, as model. Their phylogeographies provide evidence
   that speciation of chelonians fits the allopatric speciation model, with
   both species being in the parapatric phase of speciation, and that
   intrinsic isolation mechanisms are developed during speciation.
   Hybridization between M. caspica and M. rivulata is very rare,
   suggesting that the increasing numbers of hybrids in other species are
   caused by human impact on environment (breakdown of ecological
   isolation). Genetic differentiation within M. caspica and M. rivulata
   resembles the paradigm of southern genetic richness and northern purity
   of European biota. However, in west Asia this pattern is likely to
   reflect dispersal and vicariance events older than the Holocene. For M.
   caspica three distinct Pleistocene refuges are postulated (Central
   Anatolia, south coast of Caspian Sea, Gulf of Persia). Morphologically
   defined subspecies within M. caspica are not supported by genetic data.
   This is one of the few studies available about the phylogeography of
   west and central Asian species.},

Abstract = {The misuse of antibiotics and oxygen-lacking in aquaculture causes
   serious water environmental problems. Herein, a piezoelectic odd-layered
   MoS 2 is prepared and applied to piezo-catalytic remove tinidazole (TNZ)
   and other antibiotic pollutants with aeration as a piezo-driving force.
   About 89.6\% of TNZ can be degraded by MoS 2 under aeration in the
   presence of dissolved oxygen with a reaction rate constant of 0.15 min
   -1 , which is 2.4 times higher than that under N 2 atmosphere and
   quiescence conditions. Quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic
   resonance (EPR) tests identify that singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) and
   superoxide radical (O 2 \& BULL; -) are dominant reactive oxygen species
   in MoS 2 /aeration system. These results demonstrate that MoS 2 can
   trigger a piezoelectric effect and produce charge carriers to generate
   reactive oxygen species with dissolved oxygen (DO) for contaminant
   degradation with the turbulence and water bubbles rupture driven by
   aeration.\& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese

Abstract = {In this research, green synthesized magnesium oxide nanoparticles (MgO
   NPs) from lemon fruit extracts and their fungicidal potential was
   evaluated against Alternaria dauci infection on carrot (Daucus carota
   L.) under greenhouse conditions. The scanning and transmission electron
   microscopy (SEM and TEM) and ultra-violet (UV) visible spectroscopy were
   used to validate and characterize MgO NPs. The crystalline nature of
   MgONPs was determined using selected area electron diffraction (SAED).
   MgO NPs triggered substantial antifungal activity against A. dauci when
   exposed to 50 and 100 mg L-1 concentrations but the higher antifungal
   potential was noticed in 100 mg L-1 under in -vitro conditions. In
   fungal inoculated plants, a marked decrease in growth, photosynthetic
   pigments, and an increase in phenol, proline contents, and
   defense-related enzymes of carrot were seen over control (distilled
   water). However, foliar application of MgO NPs at 50 and 100 mg L-1
   resulted in significant improvement of plant growth, photosynthetic
   pigments, phenol and proline contents, and defense enzymes activity of
   carrots with and without A. dauci infection. Spraying of MgO NPs at 100
   mg L-1 had more plant length (17.11\%), shoot dry weight (34.38\%),
   plant fresh weight (20.46\%), and root dry weight (49.09\%) in carrots
   when challenged with A. dauci over inoculated control. The leaf blight
   indices and percent disease severity were also reduced in A. dauci
   inoculated plants when sprayed with MgO NPs. The non-bonding
   interactions of Alternaria genus protein with nanoparticles were studied
   using molecular docking.},

Abstract = {The aim of article is to research specificities of small business
   development across the Russian Federation regions based on the using of
   cluster analysis and regression models. In the first step of our study
   the clustering of regions according indicator of turnover on revenue per
   small enterprise is conducted. In the second step, the regression models
   on dependence the revenue turnover per small enterprise from a set of
   socioeconomic determinants and infrastructure were constructed.
   The results of the study revealed four groups of regions while the most
   significant factors positively affect the revenue turnover per one small
   enterprise are average income per capita, investments in fixed assets
   per capita, and the total volume of construction. Among the factors
   negatively affecting the revenue turnover per one small enterprise are
   number of organizations, conducting educational pre-schooling activity,
   the share of unprofitable enterprises, depreciation of fixed assets and
   proportion of motorway with hard surface in the overall length of
   highways. The results of research may be used in the creation of
   regional small business development programs.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of a theoretical-legal analysis of
   uncertainty of the legal reality and legal consciousness as special
   subjects of (new) status, and ordinary citizens. Meaning of
   ``uncertainty of the legal reality{''} is refined on the basis of a
   number of attitudes of social philosophy, including: one form of
   Government, social uncertainty, dependence on the manifestations of
   activity subject of social communication-person (citizen); social
   givens, which does not allow to focus on the sustainable social rules
   and practices, therefore, the decision always involves risk and
   accompanies stress for actors. Some of the justified theoretical
   generalizations include: uncertainty of the legal reality, in principle,
   not to be overcome, since the State of awareness is a deterministic
   public entity status (creator of law regarded); the legal reality is
   possible only to minimize the uncertainty. This task assumes that you
   have a solid scientific basis, which as the organic segment, comprises
   deeply and comprehensively developed doctrine of Pravosoznanii based on
   the integral understanding of the right type.},

Abstract = {The histological structure and clinical blood parameters of mature
   female and male beaked redfish, Sebastes mentella, from the pelagic zone
   of the Irminger Sea, Northeast Atlantic allowed for the first time to
   describe the features of the morphological structure of their bodies and
   to present the characteristics of blood cells. The diameter of white and
   red muscle fibers along the body (from head to tail) in females and
   males is significantly different. In addition, females differ from males
   in the distribution of fiber density along the body. The morphology and
   sizes of erythropoietic cells and leukocytes in females and males of the
   beaked redfish are similar to those of other fish species. However,
   erythropoiesis and leukopoiesis in males and females are not the same.
   Significant differences in the composition of the somatic muscles of
   females and males indicate a higher rate of metabolic processes in
   females. In the leukogram of females, the proportion of mature segmented
   neutrophils is significantly higher than that in males. Therefore,
   females have a higher cellular factor of innate immunity. Segmented
   neutrophils are the main microphages with high antigenic activity,
   providing phagacytosis due to defensin in lysosomes and performing
   direct killer actions.},

   studied species revealed a large portion of segmented neutrophils and
   myelocytes in walleye pollock, which indicates a significant potential
   of the cellular factor of its innate immunity and a greater activity of
   corticosteroid hormones. The most active erythropoiesis observed in
   G.chalcogrammus is probably related to substantial vertical migrations,
   as are specific for the species, associated with sharp pressure
   variations and the necessity to provide the body with oxygen. The high
   level of leukopoiesis revealed in the saffron cod is assumed to be
   caused by ecological adaptations of the species to inhabit both fresh

Abstract = {Anguis colchica orientalis is an endemic subspecies of the eastern slow
   worm that lives along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. This
   reptile usually inhabits forests in the Talysh and Alborz mountains,
   Lenkoran and South-Caspian lowlands from -27 to 1890 m above the sea
   level (a. s. l.). The majority of localities (82\%) are scattered across
   the coastal lowlands and low mountains. In order to study the
   distribution and estimate ecological preferences of the species, we
   applied maximum entropy modeling using 108 localities from Azerbaijan
   and Iran. The range of the subspecies covers mainly coastal lowlands,
   eastern slopes of the Talysh and northern slopes of the Alborz ridges.
   Of the parameters included in the model, slope, barren land and
   precipitation of driest month were the variables with the highest
   percentage contributions (29, 16, and 10\%, respectively). The slow worm
   does not avoid human-transformed biotopes and is common in some
   localities. The main threat to Hyrcanian populations of the slow worm is
   degradation of suitable habitats, primarily a total deforestation.},

Abstract = {The article reveals the need for internal control in the economic
   security system of agricultural and processing organizations. The
   objective of the study is to establish the function of internal control
   in the economic security system of agricultural and processing
   organizations, as a mechanism for identifying risks and threats. In
   accordance with this objective, the main task was determined, to
   substantiate the theoretical and practical aspects of internal control
   in the economic security system of agricultural and processing
   organizations. The work examines the substantive and formal
   methodological aspects, including the study of laws, theories, the
   structure of scientific knowledge, the analysis of research methods from
   the point of view of logical structure and the formalized approaches for
   the construction of the theoretical knowledge, its truth and
   argumentation. The classification of internal control in the
   organization's economic security system is offered. A list of mandatory
   internal control elements has been determined in the organization's
   economic security system. The methods and procedures are grouped by
   functional components in the economic security system.},

Title = {Population biology and exploitation status of four commercially
   important marine fishes of the northern Bay of Bengal, India},
Journal = {IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {62-83},
Abstract = {In the present paper population structure of four commercially important
   fishes were studied, namely Tenualosa ilisha, Pampus argenteus,
   Scomberomorus guttatus and Osteogeneiosus mihtaris, in the Sundarban
   Estuary of the northern Bay of Bengal from June 2011 to March 2012.
   However, a thorough understanding of life history based on length and
   weight data of these four fishes (617 T ilisha, 485 P. argenteus, 351 S.
   guttatus and 416 O. mihtaris) would be immensely important. Results of
   such studies would be important for sustainable management of these
   highly economic biological resources. The analysis of life history
   parameters of these four species, such as growth, exploitation,
   mortality, etc. showed that their stocks in coastal waters off West
   Bengal were overexploited during the study period as exploitation rate
   of T ilisha, P. argenteus, S. guttatus and O. mihtaris were 0.78, 0.62,
   0.75 and 0.54 respectively. Widespread fishing of juvenile and growing
   fish declined the population considerably losing the economic advantage.
   Good governance, strong law enforcement and effective management system
   should be sure for actual benefit from the fish resources and improving
   livelihoods of dependent communities.},

Abstract = {The problem of a cultural approach realization to the specialist
   professional competences formation in the realities of the modern
   education is discussed in the article. The present realities which are
   characterized by the request of the society for a ``new type
   specialist{''} give new requirements for education. Modern education can
   be supposed effective only when it, by forming the professional
   competences which are necessary for human life, will be comprehended
   from a cultural point of view as a person's entry into culture. The
   article reveals the key competences which are necessary for any
   specialist in the present day realities, thanks to which his
   socialization and self-realization processes will proceed successfully.
   The historical background and universal conceptual ideas of the
   culturological approach realization to the specialist professional
   competences formation in the realities of the modern education without
   paying attention to the direction and profile of the specialist training
   are discovered in the article.The aim of the research is to characterize
   the essential ideas and opportunities for the cultural approach
   realization to the specialist professional competences formation in the
   realities of the modern education. Our research methodology was based on
   the application of the theoretical and practical methods complex,
   including such methods as the special cultural, philosophical,
   psychological, pedagogical and scientific-methodical literature
   extensive study on the stated problem, as well as educational and
   methodical documentation study of educational organizations based on
   analysis, synthesis, theoretical modeling; professional students
   development observation and analysis (with the help of questionnaires
   and tests made by the authors of this article). As the research result
   we made a conclusion that the specialist professional formation in the
   realities of the modern education goes simultaneously with the process
   of his humanitarian and personal development. Personal qualities
   (attitudes, motives, intelligence, emotional and volitional sphere of a
   person) determine the quality of his professional competences formation.
   The educational organization task is to create the favourable conditions
   for the student ``entry{''} into the culture, it means to form a
   creative, culturologically filled educational environment for making an
   inimitable and unique professional and personal development of the
   modern specialist pathway in each case as the Culture Creator.},

   monitoring on board the fishing vessels in the exclusive economic zones
   of Morocco and Mauritania in the years 2004-2017. A larger number of
   immature erythropoietic cells was recorded in the alfonsino, which is
   probably due to its possible vertical feeding migrations to greater
   depths with high pressure and low oxygen content. The analysis of
   erythropoiesis and the leukocyte formula revealed features of
   physiological and immunological aspects. Bonito has a higher monocyte
   content than atlantic chub mackerel and alfonsino, which indicates a
   high level of innate cellular immunity, represented by phagocytosis.},

Abstract = {The main theories of motivation have been divided into two directions:
   substantial theories that consider motivation from structural positions,
   and procedural theories that consider motivation as a dynamic formation.
   These areas are united by the understanding of motivation as secondary
   formation to the motive. In this study the concept of ``readiness{''}
   for activity is considered as an active-effective state of the
   individual. In the structure of professional readiness of the
   individual, researchers identify different components, among which the
   most important is the motivational - attitude to the profession, the
   need to complete the task successfully and interest in the activity. Of
   the main goal of this study is considering psychological readiness as a
   complex functional, psychological and personal formation. As follows in
   this study, psychological study includes: a positive attitude to a
   particular type of activity; adequate to the requirements of the
   character and temperament; the necessary knowledge, skills, habits;
   stable professionally important features of cognitive and
   emotional-volitional processes. The study persues a model of formation
   of positive motivation through a professional activity of subjects of
   education in terms of reinforcement on the basis of the following
   principles: taking into account all kinds of needs of the individual;
   taking into account the real contribution of each employee to the final
   result.},

Abstract = {The article addresses natural hazards based on the analysis of the
   landscape of the territory. Methods such as mapping and zoning, the
   analysis of scientific literature, the study of maps of various scales,
   satellite photos and images, GPS data and landscape studies of
   mountainous areas of the southern Elbrus region have been used. As a
   result, landscapes have been identified with certain types of land use
   and natural hazard processes in the Baksan river basin, which will allow
   adjusting the degree of natural hazard according to the type of land
   use, and determining recommendations for potential development. safe and

Title = {History, demography and genetic status of Balkan and Caucasian <i>Lynx

Abstract = {Aim Genome-wide genetic data can provide key input for both taxonomy and
   conservation, but its use in this context remains limited. In this
   study, we performed the first genome-wide assessment of genetic
   variation in two populations of the Eurasian lynx, the Balkan
   population, the most threatened, and the Caucasian population, a
   possible glacial refugium, with the aim to place them in the context of
   the species, investigate their demographic history and evaluate their
   genetic status. Location The Balkans and the Caucasus. Methods We
   obtained whole genome resequencing data from seven Balkan and 12
   Caucasian lynx, and analysed them along with novel and existing data
   from other populations. Based on a total 105 whole genome and 114
   mitogenome sequences, we reconstructed phylogenetic and historical
   relationships, ancient and recent demography, and patterns of genetic
   diversity and inbreeding. Results Both the Balkan and the Caucasian lynx
   appear as distinct mitochondrial lineages that diverged from the rest of
   the Eurasian lynx lineages ca. 92.6 kya, and from each other ca. 46.4
   kya. Autosomal data suggest, however, that the Balkan lynx is closely
   related with the Carpathian population, and revealing alarmingly low
   genetic diversity and high inbreeding. In contrast, the Caucasian lynx
   shows a longer history of relative isolation from the rest of lynx
   populations and high genetic diversity, consistent with its large
   long-term effective population size. Main conclusions The taxonomic
   status of the Balkan lynx remains unresolved due to the evidence of
   long-term isolation in the mitogenome, contrasting with extensive
   autosomal admixture and intense recent genetic drift in the nuclear
   genome. Our results alert on genetic risks and call for the
   consideration of genetic rescue from closely related Carpathian lynxes.
   In contrast, substantial mitogenomic and autosomal divergence with no
   signs of genetic drift supports the identification of the Caucasian lynx
   as a separate subspecies with good genetic health.},

Abstract = {Today, a small number of full-fledged multifunctional CT systems are
   used for planning intraoperative intervention using mixed reality, for
   example, in cardiovascular surgery and urology, especially in Oncology.
   Surgeons today need a wide field of view to operate. Currently, the use
   of technologies like the DaVinci robot surgeon is constrained by the
   bulkiness of software and hardware solutions, the lack of trained
   specialists, and the high cost of equipment. There is no technology for
   navigating the course of the operation, with a layer of mixed reality
   being applied to the patient during the operation, so that the surgeon
   can use it to track the position of the organ, organ systems, and
   surgical instruments in real-time. The developed software prototype
   allows you to create three-dimensional models of internal organs based
   on computer and magnetic resonance imaging images with the possibility
   of simulating surgical intervention. Augmented reality glasses are also
   used to practice the skills of operations on a virtual patient using
   phantom dummies, linking surgical instruments to holography, as well as
   fully combining the simulation of the preoperative period with a real
   patient in real-time. Copyright (C) 2013 - All Rights Reserved -

Abstract = {The genus Platyscelis Latreille, 1818 (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae:
   Platyscelidini) from China is revised. Sixteen valid species
   (subspecies) are recognized in this study, including three new ones: P.
   (s. str.) acutipenis sp. nov. from Gansu and Ningxia, P. (s. str.)
   densipunctata sp. nov. from Gansu, and P. (s. str.) helanensis sp. nov.
   from Inner Mongolia and Ningxia. A synonymy between P. (s. str.) brevis
   Baudi di Selve, 1876 and P. ballioni Reitter, 1889 is proposed based on
   the examination of type and additional specimens. Lectotypes are
   designated for P. hauseri Reitter, 1899, P. gebieni Schuster, 1915, P.
   (s. str.) angusticollis Kaszab, 1940, P. (s. str.) licenti Kaszab, 1940,
   P. (s. str.) platytarsis Kaszab, 1940 and P. (s. str.) suiyuana Kaszab,

   aedeagus, and a key to Chinese species are presented.},

Abstract = {Tortoises of the Testudo graeca complex inhabit a patchy range that
   covers part of three continents (Africa, Europe, Asia). It extends
   approximately 6500 kin in an east-west direction from eastern Iran to
   the Moroccan Atlantic coast and about 1600 km in a north-south direction
   from the Danube Delta to the Libyan Cyrenaica Peninsula. Recent years
   have seen a rapid increase of recognized taxa. Based on morphological
   investigations, it was suggested that this group consists of as many as
   20 distinct species and is paraphyletic with respect to T. kleinmanni
   sensu lato and T marginata. Based on samples from representative
   localities of the entire range, we sequenced the mitochondrial
   cytochrome b gene and conducted nuclear genomic fingerprinting with ISSR
   PCR. The T graeca complex is monophyletic and sister to a taxon
   consisting of T kleinmanni sensu lato and T marginata. The T graeca
   complex comprises six well-supported mtDNA clades (A-F). Highest
   diversity is found in the Caucasian Region, where four clades occur in
   close neighbourhood. This suggests, in agreement with the fossil record,
   the Caucasian Region as a radiation centre. Clade A corresponds to
   haplotypes from the East Caucasus. It is the sister group of another
   clade (B) from North Africa and western Mediterranean islands. Clade C
   includes haplotypes from western Asia Minor, the southeastern Balkans
   and the western and central Caucasus Region. Its sister group is a
   fourth, widely distributed clade (D) from southern and eastern Asia
   Minor and the Levantine Region (Near East). Two further clades are
   distributed in Iran (E, northwestern and central Iran; F, eastern Iran).
   Distinctness of these six clades and sister group relationships of (A +
   B) and (C + D) are well-supported; however, the phylogeny of the
   resulting four clades (A + B), (C + D), E and F is poorly resolved.
   While in a previous study (Fritz et a]., 2005a) all traditionally
   recognized Testudo species were highly distinct using mtDNA sequences
   and ISSR fingerprints, we detected within the T graeca complex no
   nuclear genomic differentiation paralleling mtDNA clades. We conclude
   that all studied populations of the T graeca complex are conspecific
   under the Biological Species Concept. There is major incongruence
   between mtDNA clades and morphologically defined taxa. Morphologically
   well-defined taxa, like T g. armeniaca or T g. floweri, nest within
   clades comprising also geographically neighbouring, but morphologically
   distinctive populations of other taxa (clade A: T g. armeniaca, T g.
   ibera, T g. pallasi; clade D: T g. anamurensis, T g. antakyensis, T g.
   floweri, T g. ibera, T g. terrestris), while sequences of
   morphologically similar tortoises of the same subspecies (T g. ibera
   sensu stricto or T g. ibera sensu lato) scatter over two or three
   genetically distinct clades (A, C or A, C, D, respectively). This
   implies that pronounced morphological plasticity, resulting in
   phenotypes shaped by environmental pressure, masks genetic
   differentiation. To achieve a more realistic taxonomic arrangement
   reflecting mtDNA clades, we propose reducing the number of T graeca
   subspecies considerably and regard in the eastern part of the range five
   subspecies as valid (T g. armeniaca, T g. buxtoni, T g. ibera, T g.
   terrestris, T g. zarudnyi). As not all North African taxa were included
   in the present study, we refrain from synonymizing North African taxa
   with T g. graeca (mtDNA clade B) that represents a further valid
   subspecies.},

Abstract = {Local adaptations to the environment are an important aspect of the
   diversity of a species and their discovery, description and
   quantification has important implications for the fields of taxonomy,
   evolutionary and conservation biology. In this study, we scan genomes
   from several populations across the distributional range of the Eurasian
   lynx, with the objective of finding genomic windows under positive
   selection which may underlie local adaptations to different
   environments. A total of 394 genomic windows are found to be associated
   to local environmental conditions, and they are enriched for genes
   involved in metabolism, behaviour, synaptic organization and neural
   development. Adaptive genetic structure, reconstructed from SNPs in
   candidate windows, is considerably different than the neutral genetic
   structure of the species. A widespread adaptively homogeneous group is
   recovered occupying areas of harsher snow and temperature climatic
   conditions in the north-western, central and eastern parts of the
   distribution. Adaptively divergent populations are recovered in the
   westernmost part of the range, especially within the Baltic population,
   but also predicted for different patches in the western and southern
   part of the range, associated with different snow and temperature
   regimes. Adaptive differentiation driven by climate does not correlate
   much with the subspecies taxonomic delimitations, suggesting that
   subspecific divergences are mostly driven by neutral processes of
   genetic drift and gene flow. Our results will aid the selection of
   source populations for assisted gene flow or genetic rescue programs by
   identifying what climatic patterns to look for as predictors of
   pre-adaptation of individuals. Particularly, the Carpathian population
   is confirmed as the best source of individuals for the genetic rescue of
   the endangered, isolated and genetically eroded Balkan population.
   Additionally, reintroductions in central and western Europe, currently
   based mostly on Carpathian lynxes, could consider the Baltic population
   as an additional source to increase adaptive variation and likely
   improve adaptation to their milder climate.},

Abstract = {Background
   The ``Flora of Russia{''} project on iNaturalist brought together
   professional scientists and amateur naturalists from all over the
   country. Over 10,000 people were involved in the data collection.
   New information
   Within 20 months, the participants accumulated 750,143 photo
   observations of 6,857 species of the Russian flora. This constitutes the
   largest dataset of open spatial data on the country's biodiversity and a
   leading source of data on the current state of the national flora. About
   87\% of all project data, i.e. 652,285 observations, are available under
   free licences (CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-NC) and can be freely used in
   scientific, educational and environmental activities.},

Title = {Catalogue of bat viruses (2020)},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {6-30},
Abstract = {Aim. Aim of this the research presented in this article is to analyze
   the representation of bat (Chiroptera) viruses in various taxa of the
   Virae kingdom.
   Discussion. Currently, 260 viruses are associated with bats belonging to
   19 orders, 28 families (9 DNA-containing and 19 RNA-containing) and 61
   genera (18 DNA-containing and 43 RNA-containing). This number includes
   viruses annotated by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of
   Viruses (excluding synonymous species) for which the taxonomic status
   has been verified by sequencing subgenomic or full-genomic nucleotide
   sequences. A large number of unidentified strains from bats are
   noteworthy - they apparently contain many future prototype viruses for
   new taxa.
   Conclusion. The data presented in this article will undoubtedly be
   expanded in the nearest future. This is due to the need to improve the
   system for prevention of dangerous epidemic and pandemic situations
   primarily by increasing priority attention on bat viruses. Therefore,
   the catalogue of bat viruses, known as of mid-2020, presented in this
   paper could be considered as a kind of ``starting point{''} for future
   research in this area.},

Title = {Spatial and Temporal Variability in Migration of a Soaring Raptor Across
   Three Continents},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Disentangling individual- and population-level variation in migratory
   movements is necessary for understanding migration at the species level.
   However, very few studies have analyzed these patterns across large
   portions of species' distributions. We compiled a large telemetry
   dataset on the globally endangered Egyptian Vulture Neophron
   percnopterus (94 individuals, 188 completed migratory journeys), tracked
   across similar to 70\% of the species' global range, to analyze spatial
   and temporal variability of migratory movements within and among
   individuals and populations. We found high migratory connectivity at
   large spatial scales (i.e., different subpopulations showed little
   overlap in wintering areas), but very diffuse migratory connectivity
   within subpopulations, with wintering ranges up to 4,000 km apart for
   birds breeding in the same region and each subpopulation visiting up to
   28 countries (44 in total). Additionally, Egyptian Vultures exhibited a
   high level of variability at the subpopulation level and flexibility at
   the individual level in basic migration parameters. Subpopulations
   differed significantly in travel distance and straightness of migratory
   movements, while differences in migration speed and duration differed as
   much between seasons and among individuals within subpopulations as
   between subpopulations. The total distances of the migrations completed
   by individuals from the Balkans and Caucasus were up to twice as long
   and less direct than those in Western Europe, and consequently were
   longer in duration, despite faster migration speeds. These differences
   appear to be largely attributable to more numerous and wider geographic
   barriers (water bodies) along the eastern flyway. We also found that
   adult spring migrations to Western Europe and the Balkans were longer
   and slower than fall migrations. We encourage further research to assess
   the underlying mechanisms for these differences and the extent to which
   environmental change could affect Egyptian Vulture movement ecology and
   population trends.},

Title = {Coat Polymorphism in Eurasian Lynx: Adaptation to Environment or

Abstract = {We studied the relationship between the variability and contemporary
   distribution of pelage phenotypes in one of most widely distributed
   felid species and an array of environmental and demographic conditions.
   We collected 672 photographic georeferenced records of the Eurasian lynx
   throughout Eurasia. We assigned each lynx coat to one of five
   phenotypes. Then we fitted the coat patterns to different environmental
   and anthropogenic variables, as well as the effective geographic
   distances from inferred glacial refugia. A majority of lynx were either
   of the large spotted (41.5\%) or unspotted (uniform, 36.2\%) phenotype.
   The remaining patterns (rosettes, small spots and pseudo-rosettes) were
   represented in 11.0\%, 7.4\%, and 3.9\% of samples, respectively.
   Although various environmental variables greatly affected lynx
   distribution and habitat suitability, it was the effect of least-cost
   distances from locations of the inferred refugia during the Last Glacial
   Maximum that explained the distribution of lynx coat patterns the best.
   Whereas the occurrence of lynx phenotypes with large spots was explained
   by the proximity to refugia located in the Caucasus/Middle East, the
   uniform phenotype was associated with refugia in the Far East and
   Central Asia. Despite the widely accepted hypothesis of adaptive
   functionality of coat patterns in mammals and exceptionally high
   phenotypic polymorphism in Eurasian lynx, we did not find well-defined
   signs of habitat matching in the coat pattern of this species. Instead,
   we showed how the global patterns of morphological variability in this
   large mammal and its environmental adaptations may have been shaped by
   past climatic change.},

Abstract = {The relationship between the genera Colasia Koch, 1965 and Belousovia
   Medvedev, 2007 within the tribe Blaptini is discussed, and a new
   synonymy is proposed: Belousovia Medvedev, 2007, syn. nov. of Colasia
   Koch, 1965. As a result, three new combinations are established: Colasia
   helenae (Medvedev, 2007), comb. nov., C. kabaki intermedia (Medvedev,
   2007), comb. nov., and C. kabaki kabaki (Medve-dev, 2007), comb. nov.
   Colasia akisoides Koch, 1965 is redescribed, and a lectotype is
   designated. Three new species of the genus Colasia are described and
   illustrated from China: C. bijica sp. nov. (Guizhou), C. medvedevi sp.
   nov. (Yunnan), and C. pilosa sp. nov. (Yunnan). A distribution map and a
   key to species of the revised genus Colasia are presented.},

Abstract = {Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes are commonly used markers
   for monitoring adaptive genetic and evolutionary potential of species.
   In this study, we investigated genetic variation of the MHC class II DRB
   locus in the chamois genus Rupicapra by using next-generation
   sequencing. Sequencing of 102 samples led to the identification of 25
   alleles, 11 of which are novel. The high ratio of the relative rates of
   nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations (dN/dS) suggests a signal of
   positive selection on this locus. We analyzed patterns of genetic
   variation within and among 2 subspecies of Northern Chamois and compared
   them to previously published studies using neutral markers to provide a
   basis for assessing the effects of demographic processes. Our analyses
   have shown that alleles are likely to be maintained by balancing
   selection in different populations with similar frequencies and that
   this mechanism also works in small, isolated populations that are
   strongly affected by genetic drift.
   In this study on the chamois genus Rupicapra, researchers explored
   genetic variation of the MHC class II DRB locus using next-generation
   sequencing. The research highlights a strong signal of positive
   selection at this locus, indicated by the high dN/dS ratio. The study
   also revealed that balancing selection maintains alleles across
   different chamois populations, including those that are small and
   isolated, emphasizing the evolutionary significance of this genetic
   mechanism.

Title = {The fossil mite family Archaeorchestidae (Acari, Oribatida) I:
   redescription of <i>Strieremaeus illibatus</i> and synonymy of
   <i>Strieremaeus</i> with <i>Archaeorchestes</i>},
Journal = {ZOOTAXA},

Abstract = {Strieremaeus is one of several oribatid mite genera proposed by Max
   Sellnick based on adult specimens preserved in Eocene Baltic amber. The
   original specimens of its type-species-S. illibatus Sellnick, 1918-were
   lost and the genus has received no further empirical study. For many
   years Strieremaeus was included in the family Eremaeidae, but recently
   this placement was questioned. Herein we redescribe S. illibatus based
   on the study of 31 non-type adult specimens from both Baltic and Rovno
   ambers. Among these are four Baltic specimens identified by Sellnick and
   currently deposited in the Kaliningrad Museum of Amber (KMA), which we
   designate as neotype (KMA 197-36) and paraneotypes (KMA 197-34, 197-35,
   and 197-37). Six immature specimens were associated with this species,
   of which three-one deutonymph, two tritonymphs-could be studied in
   detail and their characters are included in the redescription. The type
   specimens of a second species of Strieremaeus proposed by Sellnick-S.
   cordiformatus Sellnick, 1918-are also lost and two non-type specimens in
   the KMA seem to have been misidentified by Sellnick; therefore, we treat
   S. cordiformatus as a species inquirenda. A new diagnosis of
   Strieremaeus is presented, and the Cretaceous fossil genus
   Archaeorchestes is considered a junior subjective synonym, based on
   examination of the holotype of the type-species, A. minguezae Arillo \&
   Subias, 2000. As a consequence, Strieremaeus is currently the sole genus
   in Archaeorchestidae. Strieremaeus minguezae (n. comb.) is only
   tentatively maintained as a distinct species, as no certain
   distinguishing traits could be found. Two families are reported from the
   fossil record for the first time: Zetomotrichidae from Baltic amber and
   Zetorchestidae from Rovno amber. In ancillary discussion we note how the
   specialized tarsal structure of S. illibatus is consistent with its
   likely arboreal habitat. We also discuss preservation properties and
   artifacts, note the dimensional discrepancy between cuticular remnants
   of the mite and its larger imprint in amber, and strongly recommend
   measuring more than the cuticular remnants themselves. Further, we
   provide information on different methods to observe amber inclusions,
   and for the first time report birefringence of fossil cuticular remnants
   in thin, airless preparations.},

Title = {The fossil mite family Archaeorchestidae (Acari, Oribatida) II:
   redescription of <i>Plategeocranus sulcatus</i> and family-group
   relationships},

Abstract = {The oribatid mite family Archaeorchestidae was proposed based on a
   single specimen of Archaeorchestes minguezae Arillo \& Subias, 2000,
   from Lower Cretaceous amber (Spain). In a previous paper we redescribed
   Strieremaeus illibatus Sellnick, 1918, from Eocene Baltic and Rovno
   amber, and considered Strieremaeus a senior synonym of Archaeorchestes.
   Herein, we transfer a second genus, Plategeocranus, to
   Archaeorchestidae. This is based on a redescription of the type species,
   P. sulcatus (Karsch, 1884), using non-type specimens (44 adults and 2
   immatures from Baltic and Rovno ambers). Among these are eight Baltic
   amber specimens identified by Max Sellnick and currently housed in two
   museums in Kaliningrad: from the Museum of the World Ocean we designate
   specimen \#39 as neotype and specimens 22, 30, 33, 35 and 37 as
   paraneotypes; from the Kaliningrad Museum of Amber we designate
   specimens 197-22 and 197-54 as paraneotypes. The contention of Arillo
   and Subias that Archaeorchestidae is a member of Zetorchestoidea
   (Eremaeoidea auct.), and is the extinct sister-family of Zetorchestidae,
   is supported with additional characters that relate to leg setation and
   the morphology of immatures. The possible inclusion of another
   Cretaceous fossil mite, Rasnitsynella punctulata Krivolutsky, in
   Archaeorchestidae or Zetorchestoidea was rejected, leaving it in
   Plateremaeidae pending the direct investigation of specimens. New
   diagnoses are presented for Plategeocranus, Archaeorchestidae, and
   Zetorchestoidea.},

Abstract = {Subcortical brain structures are integral to motion, consciousness,
   emotions and learning. We identified common genetic variation related to
   the volumes of the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, brainstem, caudate
   nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen and thalamus, using genome-wide
   association analyses in almost 40,000 individuals from CHARGE, ENIGMA
   and UK Biobank. We show that variability in subcortical volumes is
   heritable, and identify 48 significantly associated loci (40 novel at
   the time of analysis). Annotation of these loci by utilizing gene
   expression, methylation and neuropathological data identified 199 genes
   putatively implicated in neurodevelopment, synaptic signaling, axonal
   transport, apoptosis, inflammation/infection and susceptibility to
   neurological disorders. This set of genes is significantly enriched for
   Drosophila orthologs associated with neurodevelopmental phenotypes,
   suggesting evolutionarily conserved mechanisms. Our findings uncover
   novel biology and potential drug targets underlying brain development
   and disease.},

Abstract = {Cryptic phylogeographic diversifications provide unique models to
   examine the role of phylogenetic divergence on the evolution of
   reproductive isolation, without extrinsic factors such as ecological and
   behavioural differentiation. Yet, to date very few comparative studies
   have been attempted within such radiations. Here, we characterize a new
   speciation continuum in a group of widespread Eurasian amphibians, the
   Pelobates spadefoot toads, by conducting multilocus (restriction site
   associated DNA sequencing and mitochondrial DNA) phylogenetic,
   phylogeographic and hybrid zone analyses. Within the P. syriacus
   complex, we discovered species-level cryptic divergences (>5 million
   years ago {[}My]) between populations distributed in the Near-East
   (hereafter P. syriacus sensu stricto {[}s.s.]) and southeastern Europe
   (hereafter P. balcanicus), each featuring deep intraspecific lineages.
   Altogether, we could scale hybridizability to divergence time along six
   different stages, spanning from sympatry without gene flow (P. fuscus
   and P. balcanicus, >10 My), parapatry with highly restricted
   hybridization (P. balcanicus and P. syriacus s.s., >5 My), narrow hybrid
   zones (\~{}15 km) consistent with partial reproductive isolation (P.
   fuscus and P. vespertinus, \~{}3 My), to extensive admixture between
   Pleistocene and refugial lineages (<= 2 My). This full spectrum
   empirically supports a gradual build up of reproductive barriers through
   time, reversible up until a threshold that we estimate at \~{}3 My.
   Hence, cryptic phylogeographic lineages may fade away or become
   reproductively isolated species simply depending on the time they
   persist in allopatry, and without definite ecomorphological divergence.},

Title = {Fifteen shades of green: The evolution of <i>Bufotes</i> toads revisited},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {141},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The radiation of Palearctic green toads (Bufotes) holds great potential
   to evaluate the role of hybridization in phylogeography at multiple
   stages along the speciation continuum. With fifteen species representing
   three ploidy levels, this model system is particularly attractive to
   examine the causes and consequences of allopoly-ploidization, a
   prevalent yet enigmatic pathway towards hybrid speciation. Despite
   substantial efforts, the evolutionary history of this species complex
   remains largely blurred by the lack of consistency among the
   corresponding literature. To get a fresh, comprehensive view on Bufotes
   phylogeography, here we combined genome-wide multilocus analyses
   (RAD-seq) with an extensive compilation of mitochondrial, genome size,
   niche modelling, distribution and phenotypic (bioacoustics,
   morphometrics, toxin composition) datasets, representing hundreds of
   populations throughout Eurasia. We provide a fully resolved nuclear
   phylogeny for Bufotes and highlight exceptional cyto-nuclear
   discordances characteristic of complete mtDNA replacement (in 20\% of
   species), mitochondrial surfing during post-glacial expansions, and the
   formation of homoploid hybrid populations. Moreover, we traced the
   origin of several allopolyploids down to species level, showing that all
   were exclusively fathered by the West Himalayan B. latastii but mothered
   by several diploid forms inhabiting Central Asian lowlands, an asymmetry
   consistent with hypotheses on mate choice and Dobzhansky-Muller
   incompatibilities. Their intermediate call phenotypes potentially
   allowed for rapid reproductive isolation, while toxin compositions
   converged towards the ecologically-closest parent. Across the radiation,
   we pinpoint a stepwise progression of reproductive isolation through
   time, with a threshold below which hybridizability is irrespective of
   divergence (< 6My), above which species barely admix and eventually
   evolve different mating calls (6-10My), or can successfully cross-breed
   through allopolyploidization (> 15My). Finally, we clarified the
   taxonomy of Bufotes (including genetic analyses of type series) and
   formally described two new species, B. cypriensis sp. nov. (endemic to
   Cyprus) and B. perrini sp. nov. (endemic to Central Asia). Embracing the
   genomic age, our framework marks the advent of a new exciting era for
   evolutionary research in these iconic amphibians.},

Abstract = {The ``Flora of Russia{''} project on iNaturalist brought together
   professional scientists and amateur naturalists from all over the
   country. Over 3800 people participate in data collection. In one year,
   the participants collected over 220000 photo observations on 5689
   species of the Russian flora. This is the third largest dataset of open
   distributional data on the country's biodiversity (and the second
   largest for plants), a leading source of data on the current state of
   the nation's flora. For most alien species, the resulting maps are the
   most reliable distribution maps within Russia. For many municipalities,
   the resulting species lists are the most complete and accurate floristic
   information. All project data are available under free licenses and can
   be freely used in scientific, educational and environmental activities.},

Abstract = {Intracranial volume reflects the maximally attained brain size during
   development, and remains stable with loss of tissue in late life. It is
   highly heritable, but the underlying genes remain largely undetermined.
   In a genome-wide association study of 32,438 adults, we discovered five
   previously unknown loci for intracranial volume and confirmed two known
   signals. Four of the loci were also associated with adult human stature,
   but these remained associated with intracranial volume after adjusting
   for height. We found a high genetic correlation with child head
   circumference (rho(genetic) = 0.748), which indicates a similar genetic
   background and allowed us to identify four additional loci through
   meta-analysis (N-combined = 37,345). Variants for intracranial volume
   were also related to childhood and adult cognitive function, and
   Parkinson's disease, and were enriched near genes involved in growth
   pathways, including PI3K-AKT signaling. These findings identify the
   biological underpinnings of intracranial volume and their link to
   physiological and pathological traits.},
