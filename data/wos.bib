Abstract = {Individual household plot was and is one of the most common forms of
   organization of agricultural production in Dagestan, which provides
   employment in a labor-surplus region, as well as the income growth for
   rural residents of the southern region. In the 60-80s of the twentieth
   century individual household plots retained their significance despite
   the criticism and certain administrative obstacles, the rhetoric about
   the ``withering away{''} of individual household plots and the primacy
   of social production. In some industries individual household plots
   received their further development, especially after the enaction of
   certain decrees and orders in 1964, 1965, 1977 that reduced the pressure
   on the villagers who had household plots. There was the growth of
   sheepheads, especially in mountainous areas, the reactivation of farms,
   and the slow expansion of land for individual household plots. They had
   the trade growth in agriculture and its geographical expansion. It was
   noted that the commercial orientation of individual household plots was
   higher than in social farms, their material and labor costs paid off due
   to higher incomes. Such incomes were provided by the production of those
   products that were produced by little or not produced by collective and
   state farms, and therefore products were in great demand. The difficulty
   of collecting statistical data on the development of individual plots
   was noted, since they were rarely cited in statistical compilations. (C)

Title = {ON THE QUESTION OF THE REVIVAL OF THE ANCIENT MOUNTAIN VILLAGES (AULS)
   OF DAGHESTAN},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Aim. The aim of the research is to analyze the reasons for the migration
   of mountain people to the plain, the identification of the most
   significant stages of the resettlement movement in the Republic of
   Dagestan, the identification of ways to preserve and revive the mountain
   villages of Dagestan. Discussion. At present, the outflow of population
   from mountainous areas to flat land is actively continuing which leads
   to the abandonment of dozens of mountain villages. Therefore, in modern
   conditions, the urgent task is to preserve and revive the mountain
   villages of Dagestan. For this, first of all, the creation of a
   developed infrastructure, high-quality medical care and education, as
   well as the revival of traditional forms of land use, horticulture and
   cattle breeding, creation of new jobs are necessary in mountainous
   areas. The traditional habitat should be attractive for young people.
   The understanding of the problem of preservation and revival of the
   mountainous regions of Dagestan exists not only at the governmental
   level but also in Dagestan society as a whole. It is shown that the
   natural-historical and cultural complexes of Dagestan should be used for
   the development of various types of tourism, especially
   cultural-cognitive and ethno-tourism, ecological and religious tourism.
   Conclusion. Almost every ancient mountain village of Dagestan is
   actually an ethnographic museum in the open air, therefore the
   development of the tourism industry, in particular cultural-cognitive
   and ethno-tourism, will contribute to the preservation and revival of
   ancient auls in the republic.},

Abstract = {The use of woody biomass obtained from pruning and removal of perennial
   agricultural plantations for energy needs is a relatively new direction,
   which is now actively explored and developed in Europe. In Russia,
   horticulture and viticulture is also a traditional direction of
   agriculture in the southern regions, in particular, in the Republic of
   Dagestan. Dagestan is a volatile region with a variety of problems in
   the fuel and energy complex. The solution to these problems may become
   the use of renewable energy resources in the region. The paper presents
   the methodology for assessment of bioenergy resources in the region with
   the use of spatial analysis. The main purpose is to determine the
   optimal economically and technologically available energy technology for
   the estimated energy resource. The results show the high importance of
   social and economic factors for the development of renewable energy in
   the region, which is not typical for the other regions of Russia and
   should be taken into account in the further development of the
   methodology of multi-stage bioenergy resource assessment.},

Title = {CHANGES IN THE MOISTURE OF THE CASPIAN REGION OF RUSSIA DUE TO GLOBAL

Abstract = {Since the end of the twentieth century, the climate system of the planet
   has been experiencing significant changes in air temperature, due to
   anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and
   changes in the precipitation regime. Our research covers the Caspian
   region of Russia, which belongs to the southern regions of the country,
   where one of the highest rates of air temperature increase is observed.
   The Caspian region includes the Astrakhan region, Kalmykia and Dagestan.
   To assess the upcoming changes, the average daily air temperature and
   precipitation were taken, as well as the average monthly values of water
   vapor elasticity, total cloud cover for the points of Astrakhan, Elista,
   Yashkul, Lagan, Makhachkala, Buinaksk, Derbent and Akhty. To assess
   changes in natural areas, we used the Budyko radiation dryness index.
   Changes in agriculture were estimated using the Selyaninov
   hydro-climatic index. It was revealed that the upcoming changes in the
   climate system, based on the data of the ensemble of models (CMIP5),
   will lead to an increase in the radiation balance, in the average annual
   amount of precipitation, in the sum of temperatures of more than 10
   degrees C by the end of the century. Analysis of the dynamics of the
   Budyko index showed that by the end of this century, the Astrakhan
   region will still belong to the zone of subtropical deserts. Depending
   on which climate scenario the global climate system will develop, the
   region of Kalmykia may move from the zone of subtropical deserts to the
   zone of subtropical semi-deserts. The territory of Dagestan currently
   belongs to the zone of subtropical semi-desert. With the development of
   the climate scenario RCP 4.5, this territory will tend to the climatic
   conditions of the subtropical steppe zone (K = 2-3). In the development
   of the RCP8. 5 scenario, the territory of Dagestan will remain a zone of
   subtropical semi-deserts, with a tendency to transition to a zone of
   subtropical steppes. The readings of the Selyaninov hydro-climatic
   index, calculated for the period 2011-2030, indicate a continued
   deterioration of the moisture turnover conditions for the Astrakhan
   region and Dagestan in all scenarios. The humidity regime of the
   Astrakhan region will gradually deteriorate. As a result, irrigation -
   type agriculture will dominate in the Astrakhan region, while dry
   agriculture will dominate in Dagestan. According to the RCP 2.6 and RCP
   8.5 scenarios, Kalmykia will move from an irrigation farming zone to a
   dry farming zone. By the end of the century, the humidity conditions of
   the Astrakhan region and Dagestan will deteriorate even more. The
   Astrakhan region and Dagestan will remain in the zone of irrigation and
   dry farming, respectively. Kalmykia, according to the RCP 2.6 scenario,
   remains in the dry farming zone by the end of the century, according to
   the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, it again passes into the irrigation
   zone. It is obvious that some improvement associated with an increase in
   the amount of precipitation per year will contribute to the favorable
   development of natural systems (with a tendency to move from deserts to
   semi-deserts). At the same time, the conditions for the development of
   agriculture in most part of the Caspian region will deteriorate.},

Title = {THE BOUNDARIES OF THE DJAMAAT: THE PARTICULAR FEATURES OF DANGESTAN'S
   TRANSLOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THE CONTEXT OF MIGRATION FLOWS WITHIN THE
   RUSSIAN FEDERATION},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY STUDIES},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the contemporary structure and functioning of
   Dagestan's rural communities in a context of internal Russian migration,
   particularly to the cities of Western Siberia. The concepts of
   transnationalism and translocality are deployed as a theoretical
   framework to analyse the migrant and his social world without detaching
   ourselves from the donor community, the djamaat. It is argued that the
   Dagestan rural community, in the course of the migration processes of
   recent decades, can no longer be viewed merely as a local social entity.
   A new translocal community has emerged, organized on the principle of
   the `Global Village', that consists of migrants, their family members
   and non-migrants remaining in the home villages. Translocal migrants,
   existing simultaneously in several geographically separated points,
   continue to construct their identity and their social networks, a
   process that fosters a sense of belonging to a Dagestani village. The
   donor rural community is an important space where migrants can
   demonstrate personal successes and new entrepreneurial and philanthropic
   economic activities. Migrants invest not only in their own households
   but also help their native villages as a whole through entrepreneurial
   activity and financial support. In addition, the key moments of life
   remain rooted in the village. Migrants prefer to find a marriage partner
   from their home village. The home village is also seen to be the only
   acceptable burial place for deceased migrants. A major role in the
   consolidation of a translocal djamaat is played by Internet resources
   such as social networks and messenger programmes, which construct social
   networks and maintain communication among fellow countrymen in real
   time. This preference for preserving ties to one's rural locality even
   after resettlement out of the village and the Republic of Dagestan, as
   well as the maintenance of translocal links, allow us to speak of a new
   social entity: the translocal community.},

Title = {Ethnicity and fertility of descendants of rural-to-urban migrants: the

Abstract = {This paper studies ethnic differences in the fertility of the
   descendants of migrants in a highly polyethnic region of Russia,
   Dagestan (North Caucasus). That region gives a rather rare example of an
   urban population whose majority is formed by migrants and their second-
   and third-generation descendants of several ethnicities which differ in
   fertility in their rural places of origin. We take the opportunity to
   consider the key hypotheses on the fertility of the descendants of
   migrants in this rather non-standard setting. The central question we
   address is whether the ethnic differences in fertility observed among
   rural residents are also passed on to descendants of rural-to-urban
   migrants. Another question concerns the role of education in preserving
   vs. weakening ethnic differences in fertility between descendants of
   migrants. We analyze the Russian population census 2010 data on the
   region under study, running Poisson models for the total number of
   children and logistic models for progressions to different parities. Our
   main conclusion is that ethnic differences in fertility remain
   significant among descendants of rural-to-urban migrants. Arguably, this
   supports the socialization hypothesis, because contacts between
   co-ethnics are intensive in the region and interethnic marriages are
   rather infrequent, which helps young urban people to adopt patterns of
   reproductive behavior typical for their ethnicity. Among highly educated
   women, however, the ethnic differences in fertility are weaker, which
   might be related to the ease in the departure of such women from
   fertility trajectories of their co-ethnics.},

Abstract = {Aim. To carry out an ecological and faunistic review of weevils of the
   tribe Baridini Schoencherr, 1836 of Dagestan; study of the ecology and
   chorology of the most harmful species, the green rutabaga baride
   (Aulacobaris coerulescens Scop.).
   Material and Methods. The work was based on observations and materials
   obtained in 1996-2020 in various regions of Dagestan, using classical
   methods of field study of invertebrates. Collection materials and data
   from different authors for the period from 1872 to 2010 were also used.
   Stationary studies of the ecology of Aulacobaris coerulescens Scopoli,
   1763 were conducted on the basis of agricultural cooperatives and
   peasant farms of Buynaksky, Levashinsky, Akushinsky and Gergebilsky
   districts of Dagestan.
   Results. Studies have shown that the fauna of the tribe Baridini in
   Dagestan is represented by 26 species from 8 genera. In zoogeographic
   terms, it is composed of 7 complexes with the main core being formed by
   steppe species. In the attitudinal range, the fauna of lowland Dagestan
   is the richest, where 20 species live. Trophic specialization is
   dominated by broad oligophages; the main food base is the Brassicaceae
   family. The most important agricultural species and dangerous pest of
   cabbage in Dagestan is the green rutabaga baride (Aulacoboris
   coerulescens Scopoli, 1763). The features of its ecology and
   distribution were studied and a phenological table and a map of the
   range were compiled.
   Conclusion. The fauna of the Baridini tribe of Dagestan is rich and
   varied. It is represented by various zoogeographical and ecological
   complexes in all attitudinal zones of Dagestan. Phenological data and a
   distribution map of rutabaga baride can be used to optimize control
   measures and minimize impacts on ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The article examines the appellative vocabulary of the Avar and Dargin
   languages related to agriculture. Attention is paid to the analysis of
   folk geographical terms, especially agroonymic terms that form the
   to-ponymy of two ethnoregions of Dagestan. The analysis of the presented
   materials of the Avar and Dargin lan-guages shows that the vocabulary
   associated with agri- culture is well preserved in microtoponymy. The
   novelty of the study is seen in the fact that a large number of words
   related to ancient farming systems indicates the long preservation of
   archaic methods of land cultivation in the territory of the Avars and
   Dargins, which in turn led to the preservation of many farming terms and
   their consolidation in microtoponymy. The relevance of the study is due
   to the fact that the field material collected by the authors in the
   mountainous areas of Accident and Darga is introduced into scientific
   circulation, and a classification of nine semantic subgroups
   ofagroonymic terms is proposed. It is also important to analyze the
   material in the aspect of comparing farming terms in different dialects.
   The article describes the experience of the authors' long-term work in
   the study ofAvar and Dargin microtoponyms.},

Abstract = {Aim. Assessment of the incidence of leukemia virus in cattle using PCR
   diagnostics in herds of the Republic of Dagestan and study of the
   molecular genetic characteristics of circulating viruses.
   Materials and Methods. 150 cattle blood samples were examined. PCR
   diagnostics of samples for the presence of bovine leukosis virus (BLV)
   were carried out using the RealBest-Vet DNA BLV test system and a
   laboratory set of primers. Some of the samples were sequenced using the
   Sanger method and their phylogenetic analysis was performed.
   Results. Out of 150 samples, 24 samples were positive for the presence
   of BLV. In the Untsukulskiy district, no BLV DNA was detected in any of
   the 16 samples. In the Karabudakhkentskiy district out of 40 - in 2 (5
   \%), in Buynakskiy district - in 1 out of 30 (3.3 \%) and in
   Babayurtovskiy districtin 21 out of 60 samples BLV was detected (35 \%).
   For 13 BLV-positive samples, fragments of the env gene measuring 1000 bp
   were obtained and deciphered. According to phylogenetic analysis, 7
   samples of BLV belong to the 7th, and 6 - to the 4th genotype of BLV.
   The BLV genotype 4 isolated in the Babayurtovskiy district clusters with
   viruses from Kazakhstan, while viruses of genotype 4 from other farms
   cluster with Russian BLV. The studied samples of genotype 4 did not form
   common clusters. For the BLV genotype 7 isolated in farms of the
   Babayurtovskiy district, on the contrary, a combination of sequences
   into one cluster of genetically similar viruses was observed.
   Conclusion. Significant differences in the incidence of leukemia virus
   in livestock on farms in Dagestan were revealed. No patterns were found
   in the registration of cattle cases with a specific breed of cattle or
   with the age of the animal. It has been shown that viruses of both
   genotypes 7 and 4 circulate in the Republic. For BLV 4, it is assumed
   that there are different ways of its introduction into farms but no
   associated chains of virus spread have been found. For BLV genotype 7,
   transmission of BLV has been registered, which indicates the need to
   strengthen leukemia prevention measures on farms.},

   Conversations culled from fieldwork in Daghestani urban and rural spaces
   are used to elucidate the cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity
   of life in this region. Ethnographies in a bookstore, a shrine to the
   Imam Shamil, and a scholarly archive in Makhachkala unfold against the
   historical background of Daghestan's long-standing encounter with the
   Arabo-Islamic world. The essay explores how the post-Soviet turn to
   post-secular Islam represents an alternative to colonialism and a new
   way of making meaning in the present. It is intended as a contribution
   to Islamic studies, modernity theory, and post-Soviet Union area
   studies.},

Abstract = {The article deals with a craniological series from the 3rd
   (Ortoklinskoye) Gotsatlinskoye burial ground located in Mountainous
   Dagestan and dating back to the 10th-12th centuries. Based on the
   results of intragroup and intergroup comparisons, a conclusion is made
   about the differences between this sample and known paleoanthropological
   series from the territory of North Ossetia, Ingushetia, Chechnya,
   Dagestan and Georgia. The reason for this difference is a strong
   morphological heterogeneity, which, taking into account the
   peculiarities of the archaeological material, allows us to conclude that
   this burial ground was a necropolis of a Lag farm (captives, a group of
   the population with limited rights).},

Abstract = {An analysis of the avifauna of the arid Botlikh depression in the
   mountains of Dagestan, where 112 breeding bird species have been
   recorded, shows noticeable transformations in its composition noted
   during the 19th to 21st centuries. Within the arid depression, an
   increase in the number and expansion of nemoral, forest- steppe and sub-
   Mediterranean dendrophiles is observed, as well as the appearance of
   Siberian mountain- taiga species at nesting sites. At the same time,
   there is a decrease in the number and the disappearance of xerophilic
   sclerophylls, which are part of the desert- mountain faunal complex of
   the Nomadian type of fauna. This may be due to both climate change,
   which affects birds indirectly through vegetation and a reduction in the
   specific food supply, and the consequences of anthropogenic impacts on
   the natural environment (forest restoration, degradation of agriculture
   and livestock breeding), possibly also through competitive relationships
   between some animal species. Similar changes are noted not only in the
   avifauna of Dagestan, but also in the Western Caucasus, as well as in
   the steppe zone in southern Russia, this indicating large- scale
   zoogeographic processes occurring there. The identified transformations
   of regional faunas require further, intensified faunal monitoring, which
   will make it possible to clarify the speed of ongoing processes and
   provide zoogeographic forecasts for the near future.},

Abstract = {Traditional forms of marriage and wedding rituals of the peoples of
   Dagestan have always been the object of attention and study of
   ethnographers. However, it was often studied only the wedding and
   rituals of the rural population, when urban rites and forms of marriage
   are poorly described. In addition, the socio-economic, political,
   ideological and other changes that have occurred in the region in recent
   times have made certain adjustments and transformations in family and
   marriage relations. Modern forms and conditions of marriage in the
   cities of Dagestan differ in many respects from the old ones, and some
   archaic forms do not occur today at all.},

Abstract = {Aim. The environmental-epidemiological monitoring of socially
   significant pathology and its forecasting for the development of
   effective preventive measures and environmental quality management
   methods in the Republic of Dagestan
   Material and Methods. An epidemiological analysis of public health
   indicators was carried out in 41 municipalities and 10 urban districts
   of the Republic of Dagestan. This was carried out through current and
   retrospective analysis of regional health indicators,
   medical-geographical and mathematical statistical analysis. The data
   sources for the main indicators reflect the epidemiological situation in
   the Republic of Dagestan from 1997 to 2016.
   Results. An understanding of the status of the main epidemiological
   indicators of the condition of public health of the region's rural and
   urban population was obtained and future dynamics predicted. An
   integrated assessment of the well-being of the territory of the republic
   revealed areas and cities with adverse trends in public health in the
   main groups of socially significant and environmentally-related
   pathologies.
   Conclusions. An integrated assessment of the state of well-being in the
   Republic of Dagestan by groups of epidemiological indicators of general
   morbidity, general morbidity of various age groups of the population,
   socially significant and environmentally-caused morbidity, as well as a
   forecast of their dynamics, revealed adverse trends in public health in
   rural populations of Tsuntinskiy, Akhtynskiy, Gunibskiy, Kulinskiy,
   Tabasaranskiy, Nogayskiy, Novolakskiy, Suleiman-Stalskiy,
   Khasavyurtskiy, Tarumovskiy districts and of the cities of Kaspiysk,
   Dagestanskie Ogni, Makhachkala and Kizilyurt. An analysis of the sources
   of supplies of drinking water revealed a positive correlation between
   heavy metals content and adverse trends in socially significant
   pathology in the regions of Northern Dagestan.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the land-use problem of mountain and semi-desert
   landscapes of Dagestan caused by the need to improve the ecologization
   of traditional pastures as well as perspective tourism and recreational
   land use. Aim. A comprehensive geographic study of land use in the
   republic is crucial for the formation of ecologically sustainable
   distillation and nomad livestock and tourist-recreational land use on
   the natural, zonal and high-belt mountain-semi-desert landscapes that
   are not fully developed and are not suitable for farming. Discussion.
   Ecological and economic effects are revealed due to the combined use of
   semi-desert-mountain pastures and tourist-recreational areas represented
   by the population carrying capacity, the ecologization of pasture land
   use and a significant increase in the total livestock production.
   Improved combined interzonal use of lands with different natural rhythms
   of vegetation development contributes, first of all, to maintaining the
   equilibrium and integrity of the regional ecological system; secondly,
   to the ecological orientation of pasture-livestock and
   tourist-recreational land use; and thirdly, to the restoration and the
   functioning of the quality of natural semi-desert and mountain pasture
   lands. Conclusion. Ecological and landscape improvement within mountain
   pasture land use is proposed on the basis of the ecological and economic
   efficiency of the annual cycle of high-altitude sheep keeping with the
   regular change of pasture lands of different productivity levels by
   different sex and age groups of pastured livestock.},

Abstract = {The Dagestan Mountain (DM) cattle breed was established to provide
   cheese and milk products to mountain dwellers in the specific conditions
   of the Republic of Dagestan in Southern Russia. Only 650 head of DM
   cattle were registered in 2020, and their ``breed purity{''} is
   questionable. We aimed to assess the genetic diversity and population
   structure of modern DM cattle using short tandem repeat (STR) markers.
   The sample included 150 animals collected from private owners in
   Dagestan during a scientific expedition (n = 32) and provided by a gene
   pool farm (n = 118). An additional 166 samples from other cattle breeds
   distributed in the breeding zone of DM cattle were used as the
   comparison groups. The genotypes for the 11 STR loci recommended by ISAG
   were obtained using a genetic analyzer. We identified a high level of
   genetic diversity as revealed by allelic richness calculations (Ar =
   6.82 vs. 4.38-5.82 in other cattle breeds) and observed heterozygosity
   indices (uHe = 0.76 vs. 0.65-0.72). Based on the STRUCTURE results,
   animals with low levels of admixture with other breeds were found within
   the DM cattle, which can be considered as candidates for use in
   germplasm conservation programs.},

Abstract = {Given the lack of reliable first-hand sources, nobody has yet traced the
   modern history of Islamic charitable endowments in the North Caucasus
   under early Soviet rule.. is article is one of the first attempts to
   conduct such research in Daghestan. In this republic waqf foundations
   were legally acknowledged until 23 January 1927, when a decree turned
   them into national state property that would be divided among their
   previous holders in cooperatives and kolkhozes. Is it possible to
   recover the early Soviet history of waqf in the period 1920-1927, when
   it functioned under the protection of state law, while remaining almost
   completely exempt from state control and registration? What can be said
   on competing visions of waqf and its place in the Soviet discourse of
   mountaineers' survival and modernity? What role did it play in the
   countryside on the eve of collectivization? To answer these questions
   the author focuses on village communities which, as he argues,
   constituted crucial level of post-Revolutionary Islamic endowments.. is
   research introduces a unique waqf register of the 1920s from the village
   of Dibgashi. It relies on a broad range of Muslim and Soviet sources in
   the Arabic, Caucasian and Russian languages, including oral histories
   gathered by the author among contemporary villagers in Mountain

Abstract = {Studies of multilingual systems found in Indigenous small-scale
   communities often assume that exogamous marriages are the norm in such
   societies and contribute to their linguistic diversity. This paper is an
   account of the language ideology of endogamous societies in rural
   highland Daghestan (Northeast Caucasus). By studying language policing
   and language choice in infrequent mixed marriages, the paper uncovers
   the beliefs that support endogamy and reveals issues of linguistic
   identity and attitudes toward the usage of the matrilect within the
   family and the village. Interviews show that in-married women do not
   bring new languages to the villages, because they quickly acquire the
   local language new to them and use it with all their in-laws and their
   children. A strong association between villages and languages together
   with the ideology supporting linguistic homogeneity within the village
   contributes to the maintenance of the regional linguistic diversity.},

Abstract = {The mountainous Dagestan region has a unique historical development,
   likely based in independent cereal domestication and terraced
   agriculture. However, there is little to no data on the nature and
   timing of environmental changes throughout the settlement history of
   this region. In contrast to the much studied neighboring Caucasus
   regions, Dagestan remains mostly unexplored from the standpoint of
   paleoecology. Here we present a detailed radiocarbon-dated 185 cm long
   pollen record from the Shotota swamp located in the mountainous zone of
   the Eastern Caucasus (Dagestan). Peat and soil deposits of the swamp
   span most of the Holocene from the Neolithic to the Middle Ages, and
   this study, for the first time, presents an analysis of Holocene
   vegetation history and the populating of the Eastern Caucasus.
   Our analysis reveals three basic stages of transformation of natural
   conditions: a stage of predominantly warm and dry climate, open meadow
   and steppe landscapes of 9200-7300 BP associated with the Neolithic
   period; a warm and humid climate of 7300-6000 BP which accompanied the
   appearance of deciduous forests in the Chalcolithic period; and cooling
   and several phases of humidification oscillations with the constant rise
   of pine forests with 5000 BP, which are associated with the Bronze Age,
   Early Iron Age and Middle Ages. With the data obtained on the dynamics
   of vegetation, we conducted a coupled analysis of climate dynamics,
   populating and economy in Dagestan. The results of the study show
   significant discrepancies in the timing and sequence of the expansion of
   tree species in the Holocene in comparison with Transcaucasia and the
   Western Caucasus. Despite the low settlement density pollen results
   reveal signs of agricultural development in the Khunzakh plateau in the
   Chalcolithic, the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age that are not
   documented in archaeological surveys and require further investigation.},

Abstract = {The study of comparative agrobiological characteristics of productivity
   elements and their conjugation among various sort samples of huskless
   and filmed forms of oats was carried out under the conditions of the
   Republic of Dagestan.
   In the Republic of Dagestan, oats one of the promising grain fodder and
   fodder crops. The interest in this culture is explained by high feed
   qualities of grain, vegetative mass and protein content.
   The study of correlation links showed that the main structural elements
   of head productivity, of which the final result is developed i.e. a
   crop, closely interact with each other positively. The revealed negative
   interrelationships of 1000 grain weight with the head length and the
   number of grains among huskless oats confirm our conclusion about the
   expediency of breeding-valuable genotypes search and selection according
   to this feature.
   AS-7 was revealed among the studied varieties of oats and among film
   forms in terms of productivity, and Aldan among huskless forms, both

   the most important directions in the formation of a modern state
   strategy to preserve the linguistic and cultural wealth of Russia. The
   relevance of the study is due to the need to carefully study the
   processes of integration of Dagestan into the common space of Russia,
   transformation of its traditional foundations under the influence of the
   globalization and russification processes and their results. The main
   purpose of this paper is a brief analysis of the current state of
   traditional culture and daily life of the peoples of Dagestan and its
   transformation under the influence of Russian and world cultures, as
   well as of the global information openness in 1991-2000. On the basis of
   field ethnographic material, non-fiction, periodicals, sociology
   opinions and data on the Internet in the article traced the
   transformation of the external appearance of the inhabitants of the
   Dagestan, their houses, national cuisine, the ways of the celebration
   associated with the traditional spiritual life and others. The
   prerequisites and reasons for these changes are revealed, concrete ways
   of cultural transfer of Russian, European and eastern traditions to
   Dagestan, and the degree of exposure to their globalization are also
   discovered.
   It is also noted that the loss of the traditional heritage of the
   Dagestan peoples is associated with an increase in the level mobility
   among the middle generation and youth in educational, labor and leisure,
   as well as the transfer of cultural values they perceived in foreign
   countries and the subsequent replacement of their own. This leads to the
   upbringing by cultural migrants of new generation of children in
   accordance with Russian or European cultural standards. The main reason
   for this is an attempt to facilitate the further integration of
   adolescents and young people into the globalizing world. In addition,
   the process of polarization of the Dagestan society in the field of
   spiritual heritage transfer has been revealed. On the one hand, they
   raise their children mainly within the framework of the Dagestan
   traditions, strengthened by Islamic views (in some cases they turn into
   the extreme degree of Muslim radicalism), and on the other hand -
   European and Russian etiquette and culture (they often completely
   perceive their norms of morality, behavior, etc.). Moreover, the second
   group has a significant advantage, and consequently, is the source of
   innovative ideas that lead to oblivion of the traditional foundations of
   the life of the Dagestanis and the deformation of the national
   mentality.
   It is emphasized that despite the intensive introduction of cultural and
   other innovations in post-Soviet times, the modern urban and especially
   rural population of Dagestan is trying to preserve a number of
   components of its traditional material and spiritual culture.},

Abstract = {The study of religious and political attitudes of young people at the
   all-Russian and regional levels is always of great interest for the
   research community. The paper is based on the results of a mass
   political and sociological survey of 1 220 young people (aged from 18 to
   25 years old) of the Republic of Dagestan in 2017. The sociological
   survey was conducted throughout Dagestan, among young men and women
   living in cities and rural areas. The study touches upon the assessment
   of religious revival, the characteristics of the religious situation in
   Dagestan, the aggravation of the religious situation in the republic,
   the youth's preferences for social and State organization, the
   orientation of contacts with Islamic states, the attitudes of youth to
   ISIS and the likelihood of their participation in the ranks of ISIS and
   other religion-based terrorist organizations, the attitude of youth
   towards the military actions of Russia against ISIS in Syria, the
   sources of religious information, reflecting the religious component on
   interethnic relations.
   The study shows that the level of religiosity among Dagestan youth is at
   a high level, which is especially evident in some issues, and this
   causes some concern. However, this phenomenon is not critical. Young
   people remain oriented towards secularism in the State system. For young
   people, the economic and political factor is more important than the
   religious one, which has more spiritual and moral significance. The
   youth is aware of and supports the foreign policy course of the
   country's leadership and approves the military-political policy in
   Syria.},

Abstract = {Aim. To study the polymorphism of the genes calpastatin (CAST),
   somatotropin (GH) and differential growth factor (GDF9) of sheep of the
   Dagestan mountain breed.
   Material and Methods. Studies on the genetic typing of Dagestan mountain
   sheep according to CAST, GH and GDF9 genes were carried out in
   conditions of distant pasture farming in the Republic of Dagestan by the
   Genetics and Breeding Laboratory of the Federal Agrarian Scientific
   Centre of the Republic of Dagestan, an accredited laboratory of
   immunogenetics and DNA technologies of the All-Russian Research
   Institute of Sheep and Goat Breeding and a branch of the North Caucasus
   Federal Scientific Agrarian Centre. These investigations were undertaken
   by the PCR-RFLP method (polymyrase chain reaction - restriction fragment
   length polymorphism) on a Tersik four-channel programmable thermal
   cycler from DNA-Technologia (Russia) using specific primers synthesized
   in the SYNTHOL research and production laboratory (Moscow).
   Results. Carrying out PCR-RFLP revealed breed-specific alleles with
   different frequency of occurrence, which was: in the locus of the CAST
   gene - allele CAST(N) - 0.03; allele CAST(M) - 0.97; at the GH gene
   locus - GH(A) allele - 100.0, GH(B) allele - 0; in the locus of the GDF9
   gene - the GDF9(A) allele - 0.25, the GDF9(G) allele - 0.75, which
   determined the frequency of occurrence of the homo- and heterozygous
   genotypes: CAST(NN), CAST(MM) and CAST(NM) - 93.0; 0 and 7.0\%; GH(AA),
   GH(BB) and GH(AB) - 100.0 and 0\%; GDF9(AA), GDF9(GG) and GOF9(AG) -
   16.0, 66.0 and 19.0A, respectively.
   Conclusion. The regularity revealed can be considered as an ecological
   factor that optimizes the adaptive functions of the sheep's organism, on
   the one hand, an evolutionary selection process that contributes to the
   creation of a specific way of genetic structures in the population, on
   the other. The assumption is made that the information obtained can
   serve as the beginning of a more in-depth study of the unique gene pool
   of sheep of the Dagestan rock breed for its further improvement.
   Variants of genetic marker profiles of parental pairs are proposed for
   accumulation in breeding herds bred in different ecological-geographical
   zones and genotypes of carriers of selection-significant genetic
   structures.},

Abstract = {Aim. The aim of the study is to show the possibility and efficiency of
   large-scale industrial production of microalgae in the Republic of
   Dagestan for the development of agriculture (feed for animals and
   poultry) and other technological applications in the food and
   pharmaceutical industries for the production of algalin flour (eco
   bread), polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3, omega-6) physiologically
   necessary for humans, biologically active substances (astaxanthin,
   phycocyanin), new-generation antibiotics, biofuels and other high added
   value biotechnological products. The problems of using microalgae for
   bioremediation of the environment, in particular, purification of
   geothermal waters from phenols before discharging into the sewage system
   are considered. Methods. Microalgae are grown in closed and open type
   plants. Valuable algae components can be extracted using supercritical
   fluid technology of continuous action. Results. We give a comparative
   evaluation of the efficiency of using microalgae as a biological raw
   material in comparison with traditionally used oilseeds. Conclusion. For
   Dagestan, located on the shore of the Caspian Sea, with its warm climate
   and an abundance of solar and geothermal energy, the development of this
   technology is a task of great economic importance. The advantages of
   microalgae technologies are the basis for the creation of large-scale
   production of microalgae in southern Russia. Biotechnology in Dagestan
   can become not only profitable, but also a high-tech and innovative
   industry.},

Abstract = {The authors analyze the incidence of precancer dermatoses and skin
   cancer in three population groups (total n = 7500) living in various
   geographic zones of Daghestan: urban population and rural population of
   the plains and highlands, occupationally exposed to factors conducive to
   cancer development. i. e. hyperthermia, chemical irritants, high
   insolation, other environmental factors. A high incidence of skin
   precancer and cancer (0.3 and 1.3\%, respectively) was detected among
   the highlanders exposed to high insolation. Basal-cell carcinoma in
   these areas is 3-4 times more incident that squamous-cell carcinoma.
   Precancer dermatoses and skin cancer involve open skin sites in 45-80\%
   of cases. Untimely visits to doctors result in development of grave
   forms of skin cancer. Early active detection of skin precancer and
   cancer is the key point in timely diagnosis, treatment, and prevention
   of this condition, particularly of its grave forms.},

Abstract = {An American sociologist reports results of survey research conducted in
   1993 among Muslims in the five Islamic Autonomous Republics of Russia (N
   = 4,955). The data demonstrate that the strength of Islam as both a
   religious and social institution varied regionally despite the shared
   experience of Soviet anti-religious policies. Muslims in Chechnya and
   Dagestan were much more likely to report that they actively practiced
   Islam than Muslims living in Kabardino-Balkariya, Tatarstan, and
   Bashkortostan. Moroever, religious practice was high among
   non-traditional groups of Chechentsy and Avartsy. The young, the urban
   migrants, the highly educated, and men reported high levels of active
   worship. In Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, and Kabardino-Balkariya, in
   contrast, active religiosity was primarily confined to old, rural women
   with low levels of education. These differences, it is argued, are
   linked to the Sufi Islam tradition present in Chechnya and Dagestan but
   absent in the other Muslim autonomous republics.},

Journal = {LABORATORIUM-RUSSIAN REVIEW OF SOCIAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {26-51},
Abstract = {The article examines the mechanisms of functioning of internet
   communication and social networks in the translocal rural communities of
   Dagestan, a Russian Federation region in the North Caucasus, whose
   members have been participating in the labor migration to industrial
   Russian cities. Huge distances and various sociocultural and economic
   differences between the sending and the receiving societies pose a
   challenge to the unity of the rural community, djamaat. Rural identity
   is salient for migrants: they preserve the principle of rural endogamy,
   bury all the dead migrants in their village, spend money and time on the
   development of the village, and create public organizations of fellow
   villagers. The article focuses on the practice of using mobile social
   networks- Facebook and its Russian counterparts-by transmigrants, their
   families, and fellow villagers. Social media provide everyday family
   communication and serve as a platform for performing important social
   rites such as finding a bride, matchmaking, remitting money for
   condolences, as well as transferring important information between
   migrants and those living in the village. Rural chats consolidate the
   community and formulate the idea of the unity and also become power and
   economic resources for migrants. At the same time, the villagers' chats
   are the places where the laws of reputation are at work, therefore they
   can also demonstrate positive or negative social capital and carry a
   danger for migrants, especially for women.},

Title = {Stalin's Liquidation of Kulaks as Class and Organization of the Process
   of the Soviet Peasantry Proletarianization},
Journal = {HERALD OF AN ARCHIVIST},
Year = {2021},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1229-1244},
Abstract = {The article examines various aspects of the recently revealed archival
   document of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party
   (Bolsheviks) on the plan of repressive policy against the Soviet
   peasantry ``On measures to eliminate kulak farms in the areas of
   continuous collectivization.{''} The author notes that the process of
   liquidation of kulaks as class, or of depeasantrification, as it is
   often designated in the historical literature, has been well studied.
   The first and rather timid attempts to assess the problem in the terms
   of individual ``deformations of socialism{''} date to the turn the
   1990s. At present, the attention is mostly focused on the regional
   aspect, as over the past three decades there has been made available a
   complex of sources from local archives, which was previously in closed
   storage. The article analyzes preconditions of the protest sentiments in
   the course of mass collectivization undertaken by party bodies in the
   center and in the regions, as well as harsh suppression of possible
   peasant uprisings by punitive bodies, identification and persecution of
   the instigators. Examination of official party documents on
   collectivization permits to identify the ideological, social, and
   economic criteria for ranking Soviet peasants among kulaks. It is
   concluded that liquidation of kulaks as class on the territory of the
   USSR was conducted in a very short time and in two stages. At the first
   stage, in January - March 1930, repressions were to be carried out in
   the economically developed regions: the Black Earth region, the Middle
   and Lower Volga region, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus, North Caucasus,
   Dagestan, Ural, Siberia. The second stage spread them to other regions
   of Soviet Russia. The author notes an inconsistency in the thesis of
   positive economic consequences of mass collectivization and elimination
   of kulaks as class for industrialization. Taking into account their
   consequences, the author proposes to consider these two complementary
   processes initiated by the leadership of the CPSU (B) as a preventive
   campaign to intimidate the rural population in order to return to the
   methods of surplus appropriation via formation of the collective farm
   system. It has been revealed that J.V. Stalin's plans, in accordance
   with the Marxist-Leninist doctrine, included a rapid change in
   socio-economic status of peasants: from relatively free farmers,
   producers of agricultural products entitled to manage their crops (after
   paying the taxes) to hired workers, in other words, proletarians.
   According to the author, the large-scale famine of the first half of the
   1930s was a direct consequence of the so-called ``revolutionary
   transformations in agriculture,{''} the victims of which are to be
   accurately calculated.},

Abstract = {Drawing on unique interviews with former jihadists from Russia's
   autonomous republic of Dagestan, this article is the first to examine
   the impact of ethnicity on jihadist groups' methods of organization and
   operations, primarily in terms of their target selection, local support,
   and recruitment and leadership policies. It distinguishes between
   largely monoethnic rural jamaatsor jihadist groupsand multiethnic urban
   jamaats, pointing to the contested nature of ethnicity, particularly in
   the latter group. It examines the steps taken by the leadership of urban
   jamaats to overcome ethnic cleavages and avoid interethnic tension both
   within the jihadists' ranks and with regard to the local population. The
   article illustrates that, as a divisive phenomenon in multiethnic urban
   jamaats, ethnic identity has been deliberately downplayed by the
   leadership of these groups at the expense of strengthening supra-ethnic
   Salafi-jihadist identity. The article also highlights the significance
   of ethnic identity in jihadist groups, in spite of it being
   contradictory to Salafi-jihadist doctrine.},

Abstract = {Aim. To conduct a comparative analysis of the self-assessment of health
   by urban and rural residents of the Republic of Dagestan, using as
   examples the city of Makhachkala and the Untsukulskiy district.
   Material and Methods. Sociological research methods were employed on the
   basis of questionnaires.
   Results. According to the results of the study the majority of the
   residents of Makhachkala and the Untsukulskiy district surveyed - 71\%
   and 68.2\% respectively gave positive assessments of their health. In
   both samples, the proportion of respondents who rated their health as
   ``mediocre{''} and ``bad{''} increased with age. In rural areas the
   number of young and middle-aged respondents who assessed their health as
   worse exceeded the number of city dwellers of the same age. Among male
   respondents, 77.8\% in Makhachkala and 74.9\% in the Untsukulskiy
   district gave a positive self-assessment of health and among the female
   population, 66.7\% and 62.93\% respectively.
   Conclusion. Self-assessment of health is a tool recommended by the World
   Health Organization for monitoring health within selected population
   groups. The slight difference between the assessment of their health by
   urban and rural residents is due to differences in lifestyle and
   standard of living, access to medical as well as cultural, leisure and
   other types of services.},

Abstract = {Aim. The aim of the research is to consider the medical and social
   aspects of artificially terminating pregnancy in the Republic of
   Dagestan. Material and methods. To achieve this goal, we have created a
   database of the cases of artificial abortion in the Republic of
   Dagestan. Statistical processing of the results of the study was carried
   out using software packages like STATISTICA and Excel. Results. The
   total number of abortions for the study period was 157526 cases, of
   which 26\% of cases were spontaneous abortions, 8.9\% of cases were
   abortions for medical reasons. During the period under review, there was
   an increase in the number of spontaneous abortions and abortions due to
   medical indications by 170\% and 108.6\%, respectively. There is the
   prevalence of abortions of the pregnancy of up to 12 week-period,
   including mini-abortions, the average percentage of the total number of
   abortions for the study period was 90\%. In the Republic of Dagestan,
   the average annual intensive standardized abortion rate was 14.67 cases
   per 1,000 women of childbearing age women of childbearing age (WCA). And
   among the urban population, this number is higher, and amounted to 25.57
   \%o against 6.25 \%o in rural areas. The highest values of the average
   long-term intensive frequency of abortions are observed in the cities of
   Kizilyurt, Derbent, Makhachkala, Kaspiisk; in the countrysides:
   Dakhadayevsky, Tarumovsky, Laksky and Babaurtovsky districts.
   Conclusion. The problem of abortion, despite the steady tendency to
   reduce their number, still needs to be solved because it is the leading
   cause of maternal death in Russia, inflammatory diseases of the
   genitals, infertility, and it also adversely affects the course of
   subsequent pregnancies and births, increasing the frequency miscarriage,
   maternal and perinatal pathology.},

Abstract = {Wheat is a leading poaceae grain crop of the South of Russia. The value
   of wheat is that it contains gluten, which is essential for bread and
   bakery products, pasta, but its yield remains at the level of 2.5-3.0
   t/ha, although its potential is much higher. One of the reasons lies in
   the inefficient use of recommendations on energy-saving technologies
   with the introduction of calculated norms of fertilizers and increased
   requirements for the selection of recommended or regionalized
   complex-resistant crop varieties with high potential productivity,
   product quality, the ability to withstand adverse environmental
   conditions and efficiency to use soil and climatic resources in the
   region. High-quality grain production is the basis of agricultural
   policy of our country. The level of grain production currently does not
   meet the country's needs in providing with high-quality
   environmentally-friendly food grain. Opportunities to improve the
   structure of areas under wheat are reduced from year to year. In this
   regard, the increase in the gross grain harvest is possible by
   increasing the productivity of crops. Modern science and best practices
   in the European countries show that the rational use of land, the use of
   advanced technology improve soil fertility and productivity of crops,
   respectively {[}1,2]. Improvement of the highly efficient technological
   methods for flat lands of Dagestan which can ensure the preservation and
   improvement of soil fertility and on this basis the product quality
   while reducing energy and economic cost is an actual problem of modern
   agricultural production. Winter wheat occupies a leading position in the
   agricultural sector of the Republic of Dagestan, so increasing its yield
   and production of environmentally-friendly products, based on the
   rational use of mineral fertilizers is closely linked with the
   development of fertilizer systems. The introduction of calculated doses
   of mineral fertilizers into the soil balances the productivity of winter
   wheat at a high level. Land resources of Dagestan diverse in
   agro-climatic and soil resources, which affects the productivity of
   winter wheat. The need for a precise definition of the of mineral
   nutrition norms for winter wheat in the conditions of the flat zone of
   Dagestan determines its relevance and national economic importance.
   Based on the above-mentioned, the main objective of agricultural
   producers in the production of grain is high yields of high quality
   products while ensuring the oil fertility, and excluding the negative
   impact on the environment. Compensate the removal of nutrients is
   possible through the application of mineral fertilizers, and the latter
   is reflected on the quality of the grain. In our paper, we present the
   results of research on the effect of mineral fertilizers on the yield
   and quality of winter wheat. In particular, we have studied the effect
   of mineral fertilizers rates on the dynamics of the protein content, wet
   gluten and nitrates in the winter wheat grain {[}8,11,12].},

Title = {THE CHOKH ARCHAEOLOGICAL CULTURE: COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF BASIC
   COMPONENTS},
Journal = {KRATKIE SOOBSHCHENIYA INSTITUTA ARKHEOLOGII},
Year = {2023},
Number = {271},
Pages = {7-23},
Abstract = {The Chokh archaeological culture is a specific local formation
   characterized by impressive technological and typological features
   chronologically tied to the Mesolithic and Neolithic of Inner Dagestan.
   At the Neolithic stage this culture manifests itself as a
   multi-component formation composed of three diverse components. The
   triunity in this combination is unique for the Caucasus. One of the key
   components of this culture is flint industry. Its striking originality
   is emphasized by such cultural elements as small Levallois flat cores
   for flakes and four variants of points (arrowheads) of the Chokh type.
   These specific features emerged in the culture of Inner Dagestan as
   early as the Mesolithic and, without any major changes, persisted in the
   areas of medium-to-high plateaus (around 1200-1800 m above the sea
   level) and intermountain valleys. The second component of the Neolithic
   Chokh culture is reflected in ceramics which typologically and
   technologically coincide with the ceramics known in the early farming
   culture of the eastern Trans-Caucasus region (Shulaveri-Shomutepe).
   Finally, the third component is the method of exerting manual pressure
   (using a lever pressure device?) employed to obtain standardized
   microblades. Each of the described cultural components has its own
   source and/or direction of cultural links and external influences. Local
   genetic roots are traced only for the above-said specific features of
   lithic industry. Technical and typological traits of ceramics point to
   links between the Chokh population and the groups attributed to the
   Trans-Caucasus Shulaveri-Shomutepe culture. The northern vector of
   cultural impacts (northern relative to the Dagestan region), which is
   opposite to the eastern Trans-Caucasus direction of contacts, manifests
   itself in the method of exerting manual pressure in flint knapping that
   was introduced in the technological arsenal of the mountainous Neolithic
   represented by the Chokh culture.},

Title = {Evaluation of the polymorphism of the GDF9 and BMP15 genes and their
   relationship with the reproductive functions of sheep of different
   breeds},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {190-195},
Abstract = {Aim. Polymorphism is the result of evolutionary processes and is
   inherited, associated with biodiversity and modified by natural
   selection and functions to preserve various forms of population. It is
   economically advantageous to find genes that can be used in breeding in
   such a way as to increase the fertility of animals in different natural
   geographical zones, since the adaptive abilities of organisms are
   complicated. In this regard, the purpose of this study was to study the
   genetic potential of sheep of different breeds bred in various
   ecological and geographical regions of the North Caucasus with
   pasture-pasture and pasture-stall conditions of sheep breeding.
   Material and Methods. Genotyping was undertaken of sheep of different
   breeds contained in various natural and climatic zones of the Republic
   of Dagestan and the most arid region of Stavropol Territory in the zone
   of risky agriculture where the climate is sharply continental.
   Genotyping in the loci of the genes of differential growth factor (GDF9)
   and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP15) was carried out by PCR-PDRF
   (polymorphism of the lengths of restriction fragments) by cutting DNA
   using endonuclease restriction and further analysis of the size of the
   resulting PCR fragments. The genetic structure of genes has been studied
   by methods of genetic and statistical analysis of the data obtained.
   Conclusion. The genetic structure of sheep populations of different
   breeds bred in the foothills of the Republic of Dagestan and the arid
   region of Stavropol Territory was studied for the first time.
   Information obtained on the role of the degree of genetic variability of
   sheep of different breeds provides data which can contribute to the
   ecological well-being of herds and the status characterising the signs
   of multiple birth rates is also determined. This will further improve
   and significantly accelerate breeding work with livestock, since an
   important task of further increasing the efficiency of the industry is
   the reproduction of the herd together with a simultaneous increase in
   the productivity of animals.},

Abstract = {Aim. To conduct studies on the content of radionuclides Sr-90, Cs-13(7),
   Pb-210 and determine the total beta-activity in objects (samples) of the
   external environment, as well as to investigate the effect of
   radioactive isotopes on the spread of bovine leukemia in the Republic of
   Dagestan.
   Materials and Methods. Samples (haylage, natural grass, silage, compound
   feed, milk, etc.) that were obtained from various locations of the
   Republic of Dagestan were used for radiological research. The method of
   research was radiochemical analysis using the universal spectrometric
   complex ``Gamma Plus{''}, etc. For bovine leukemia the principal
   material was the reporting data of the Republican Veterinary Laboratory,
   supplemented by our own research from 1988 to 2008. The research was
   carried out by generally recognized methods in serology and hematology.
   Results. After the studies were conducted, a high content of
   radionuclides Sr-90 and Cs-137 was found in environmental objects from
   1986-198, and the activity of nuclide Pb-210 in the ecosystem of the
   republic increased tenfold compared to 1985. An important indicator such
   as the total beta-activity in the republic also increased in the period
   (from 1986-1988) after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power
   station. In 1988, we recorded the maximum number (32.2\%) of infected
   animals with the bovine leukemia virus and in subsequent years the
   percentage of hemo-diseased heads of cattle in the farms of the republic
   increased.
   Conclusion. Thus, there is a causal relationship between the activity of
   radionuclides and the decrease in the immune status of animals, which
   may lead to the increase in the spread of bovine leukemia in the
   republic.},

Abstract = {The priority task for domestic agribusiness is to ensure conditions for
   stable economic growth. To meet international standards, Russian farmers
   need to maximize production efficiency and increase the level of
   profitability of agricultural products. Positive economic dynamics in
   the agricultural sector can be achieved by attracting both extensive and
   intensive factors of production. Having an ambiguous agro-industrial
   complex, there is a serious differentiation of the food market sectors
   in terms of sufficiency, and on the other hand, there is a decrease in
   demand due to declining population real incomes. To assess the level of
   import substitution, a cluster analysis was carried out. The taxonomy of
   regional statistics divided the regions into two groups. Cluster No. 1
   (Moscow Region, Tatarstan, Krasnodar and Altai Territories,
   Bashkortostan, Voronezh Region, etc.) demonstrates serious success in
   organizing the dairy industry from the perspective of import
   substitution, since its own production satisfies not only domestic
   needs, but also ensures the export flow. Cluster No. 2 (Chelyabinsk,
   Bryansk, Omsk regions, Udmurtia, the Republic of Dagestan, etc.) is
   polar to cluster No. 1 in terms of technical and economic indicators
   characterizing the development of the dairy industry. To improve the
   sustainability of the industry and intensify the processes of import
   substitution, it is necessary to improve the system of state regulation.
   The set of necessary measures includes: physical and economic
   accessibility of loans, review of the regulatory framework in the field
   of modernization of the rural economy, stimulating the efficiency of
   agricultural production and using the green box tools (in particular,
   the food card program).

Abstract = {Aim. The unique gene pool of indigenous breeds in the Dagestan Caucasus
   is threatened by the increasingly widespread use of commercial breeds,
   which in turn risks narrowing the genetic base necessary to increase and
   maintain existing genetic diversity. For this reason, our research aimed
   to study the polymorphism of the PRL, PIT-1, GH genes in red steppe and
   Caucasian brown cattle raised in the conditions of Dagestan.
   Methods. Genotyping of red steppe and Caucasian brown cattle was carried
   out using PCR-RFLP methods. Using these methods, genetic analysis was
   carried out and polymorphism of the prolactin, somatotropin and
   pituitary-specific transcription factor genes was studied.
   Results. As a result of the genotyping of an experimental group of red
   steppe cattle, it was found that the distribution of two alleles and
   three genotypes (PIT-1A and PIT-1B; PIT-1AA, PIT-1BB, PIT-1AB) of the
   PIT-1 gene has a specific character. The specificity of the allelic
   spectrum of the PRL gene is expressed in the high (0.84) frequency of
   occurrence of the PRLA allele and low (0.16) frequency of the PRLB
   allele. This is reflected in the presence of homo- and heterozygous
   genotypes with a frequency of occurrence of 73.0; 23.0; 4.0 \%,
   respectively.
   Conclusion. Applied genetic approaches to improve the productive and
   breed qualities of livestock, which are modern and based on a more
   complete analysis of the genetic diversity and genotype of the studied
   populations, contribute to the conservation of zoned breeds. At the same
   time, intrapopulation variability and good adaptability should ensure
   the sustainable development of dairy cattle breeding in various climatic
   zones.},

Abstract = {Aim. Assessment of the extent of the distribution and danger of
   activation of landslide processes in the Republic of Dagestan.
   Material and Methods. The principal materials used were data of the
   government monitoring of subsoil conducted by Hydrospetzgeologiya and
   its southern regional and territorial centres (Dagestangeomonitoring)
   over the past fifteen years and published in the open press, as well as
   other literature sources. Maps were compiled using ArcGIS software.
   Results. An assessment was made of the extent of the distribution and
   danger of occurrence of landslide processes (for the period 2004-2018)
   in urban and rural settlements, on linear infrastructure (highways, oil,
   gas and water pipelines, power lines) and in reservoirs of large
   hydroelectric power stations of the republic. There was a high level of
   landslide activity recorded in 2004, 2005 and 2014, the lowest in 2007
   and 2012. The largest number of landslide occurrences was recorded in
   the areas of Makhachkala city (12.7\%) and Tlyarotinskiy (9.6\%),
   Dokuzparinskiy (8.1\%), Buynakskiy (6.1\%), Tsuntinskiy (5.4\%) and
   Tsumadinskiy (5.0\%) districts. Landslides were most often activated in
   the summer period (41.6\%). 31.5\% of landslides occurred in spring,
   22.6\% in autumn and 4.3\% in winter.
   Conclusion. Analysis of landslide activity in the territory of Dagestan
   showed that the presence of favorable physico-geographical conditions
   for the development of landslide processes and active economic activity
   contribute to the wide distribution of landslides in the mountainous
   part of the republic.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Tat language is classified in an Iranian subbranch of the
   Indo-European family. It is spoken in the Caucasus and in the West
   Caspian region by populations with heterogeneous cultural traditions and
   religion whose ancestry is unknown. The aim of this study is to get a
   first insight about the genetic history of this peculiar linguistic
   group. Methods: We investigated the uniparental gene pools, defined by
   NRY and mtDNA high-resolution markers, in two Tati-speaking communities
   from Dagestan: Mountain Jews or Juhur, who speak the Judeo-Tat dialect,
   and the Tats, who speak the Muslim-Tat dialect. The samples have been
   collected in monoethnic rural villages and selected on the basis of
   genealogical relationships. A novel approach aimed at resolving cryptic
   cases in the recent history of human populations, which combines the
   properties of uniparental genetic markers with the potential of
   forward-in-time computer simulations, is presented. Results: Judeo-Tats
   emerged as a group with tight matrilineal genetic legacy who separated
   early from other Jewish communities. Tats exhibited genetic signals of a
   much longer in situ evolution, which appear as substantially unlinked
   with other Indo-Iranian enclaves in the Caucasus. Conclusions: The
   independent demographic histories of the two samples, with mutually
   reversed profiles at paternally and maternally transmitted genetic
   systems, suggest that geographic proximity and linguistic assimilation
   of Tati-speakers from Dagestan do not reflect a common ancestry. (C)

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the historical and demographic analysis of the
   number and development trends of the population of the multinational
   region of the country in the 1990s - 2010s. It is shown that the
   demographic processes in the republic were negatively affected by the
   collapse in the standard of living of the bulk of the republic's
   population during the liberal market reforms in the new conditions.
   Dagestan remained one of the few regions of the country in which there
   was an increase in the number of both urban and rural populations. At
   the same time, there was a stable tendency to the predominance of the
   rural population in its total number, which was due to the predominance
   of the agrarian sector in the economy of the mountainous region, as well
   as inclination of the bulk of the population to the traditional rural
   way of life. The patterns and regional features of the formation and
   further development of urban and rural population in the republic are
   traced. It was noted that in the region there were 10 cities of
   republican subordination, the largest of which was the administrative,
   industrial and cultural center of the Republic of Dagestan- Makhachkala.
   The overall growth of the urban population in the multinational region
   as a whole and in the context of individual cities (except for the city
   of Yuzhno-Suhokumsk) continued. The author, using the materials of the
   population censuses of 1989, 2002, 2010, and other reliable statistical
   data, analyzed the sources of positive changes in the population, the
   predominant of which was the natural increase. The age and sex
   composition of the urban and rural population of the republic is
   characterized, among which the children and people of working age
   prevailed, which created favorable opportunities for the development of
   the branches of material production and the socio-cultural sphere.
   However, in the conditions of economic difficulties in the analyzed
   decades, they remained not fully realized, which caused an increase in
   the outflow of people of working age to other regions of the country in
   search of work. The same was associated with the need to increase
   attention to the development of sociocultural infrastructure in the
   region, primarily in the Dagestani village. The document focuses on the
   analysis of the national composition of the region's population, showing
   the growth of the total number of all Dagestani peoples during the
   decade under review, although the growth rates of some of them have
   varied.The changes in the zonal settlement of the population, the
   increase in its inflow into the flat areas of the republic were traced,
   which was accompanied by an increase in the overpopulation of the
   population by the aggravation of the problem of employing young people
   in the branches of the economy.},

Abstract = {The results of the clinical and epidemiological study of epilepsy in the
   Soviet region of Makhachkala city and the Khasavurt region of the
   Dagestan Republic are presented. The sample size was 139.115 in the
   Soviet region and 101.278 in the Khasavurt region, The samples included
   344 and 338 patients with epilepsy, respectively. The age- and sex-
   standardized prevalence of epilepsy was 2.06 (CI95\% 1.80-2.32) cases
   per 1000 population in the Soviet region and 2.98 (CI95\% 2.60-3.35)
   cases per 1000 population in the Khasavurt region (p=0.05). The
   prevalence of epilepsy was higher in men. Focal (location-related) forms
   of epilepsy were most frequent, with the highest frequency of partial
   seizures with secondary generalization. Cranial-brain injury, intra- and
   perinatal pathology and cerebral vascular diseases were the main causes
   of the development of focal epilepsies. Seizure frequency greater than
   12 per year was noted in more than a half of patients. The study of
   social aspects showed that only small portion of patients worked, most
   of patients received disability pensions. Differences in the education
   level were identified as well.},

Journal = {SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {The cities of oil and gas region of West Siberia have been the centers
   of attraction for migrants from the former Soviet Union for the past 60
   years. One of the most important migratory flows in the region since the
   late Soviet time comes from the Russian Caucasus and migrants from the
   Republic of Dagestan make up a noticeable percentage of it. Analysis of
   the data from the field work (2011-2016), allows to characterize
   Dagestanian migration to Khanty-Mansiysk District as translocal, when
   migrants develop and maintain multiple economic and social relations
   simultaneously in the sending and receiving societies and thus belongs
   to multiple geographic localities. I offer insight into practices of
   migrants through the lens of the idea of translocal social space. To
   explain the nature of this translocal case it is necessary to show the
   specifics of rural communities of Dagestan as one of the most relevant
   social structure in the republic. In the article I describe the
   movements which take place there as relevant social practices making
   this type of migration translocal trade activity, packages, people and
   dead bodies transportation. Migrants create demand for the regional
   products of home land as well as provide a demand. When transporting
   goods, not only economic benefits become important, but also regional
   preferences of the donor region. Solving the problems of transporting
   the dead bodies addresses the issue of consolidation of compatriots.
   Besides I pay attention to the specificity of migrant infrastructure of
   roads between a Northern city and a Dagestanian village as a part of
   translocal social space.},

Abstract = {Aim. To carry out a comparative analysis of self-rated health, medical
   activity, and satisfaction with the quality of medical care in public
   health institutions by residents of rural settlements of the Untsukul
   district, Republic of Dagestan. Methods. The study was conducted by the
   method of questioning 2643 respondents, among them 1453 women and 1181
   men. Results. According to the results of the survey, the majority of
   the interviewed residents of Untsukul district (68.2\%) are satisfied
   with their health. Medical activity of the population at the time of the
   study was 60.6\%. As to respondents who applied to the medical
   institutions of the Untsukul district during this period, 13.5\% are not
   satisfied with the quality of medical care in public health
   institutions, 23.5\% are fully satisfied, 30\% are not fully satisfied.
   Conclusion. A social survey in the form of a questionnaire is one of the
   most effective methods of obtaining information about the self-rated
   health of the population. Timely analysis of medical activity of the
   population, its satisfaction with the quality of medical care will

Abstract = {On the basis of the allelic composition of ten microsatellite loci and
   mtDNA sequences, we studied the genetic structure of the common hamster
   populations that inhabit cities and suburban settlements in Ciscaucasia.
   It was shown that, in urbanized territories, the hamster population is
   divided into separated groups, the genetic differences between which are
   high and not related to the distance between them. On the outskirts of
   cities adjacent to undeveloped or green areas and further in rural
   areas, the degree of isolation of neighboring hamster settlements
   decreases, and the level of genetic differences between them begins to
   correspond to the distance separating the settlements. In the course of
   work, this species was first registered within the territory of the
   easternmost part of Ciscaucasia, in the Republic of Dagestan.},

Abstract = {The study of agricultural terraces in mountainous Dagestan that date to
   the Middle Ages revealed the polygenetic character of anthropogenic
   soils, which reflects the main stages of their evolution. In light of
   their long-term burial, the soil layers of the preanthropogenic stage of
   evolution were characterized by fairly high values of biological
   activity, with the exception of the biomass of fungal mycelium, a small
   amount of which remained. At the early agrogenic stage, soil plowing
   without irrigation did not significantly change their microbiological
   properties; however, the increase in urease activity in some studied
   profiles may indicate that cattle fertilizers were applied in some areas
   of the terraces. During the Little Ice Age (the 16-18th centuries A.D.)
   the terraces were abandoned, which led to the accumulation of organic
   carbon in the soils as a result of the fallow process, as well as an
   increase in their enzymatic activity. The second agrogenic stage with
   irrigation was characterized by a noticeable growth in the active
   microbial biomass, the soil phosphatase activity, and, in particular,
   the urease activity, which may indicate that farming was intensive and
   organic fertilizers were applied. In the last 20 years, the development
   of terraces under natural conditions led to a noticeable growth in the
   biological activity of upper fallow horizons. However, the urease
   activity significantly decreased in nonirrigated areas, whereas the
   indicators of microbial biomass remained at the same level.},

Abstract = {Aim. The prevalence of some factors affecting the health status of
   residents of 14 rural settlements in the Untsukul District of the
   Republic of Dagestan is established. The total number of respondents was
   2,634, including 1,453 women and 1,181 men. The survey involved people
   aged 18 to 97 years. Methods. The study was carried out by a survey of
   respondents using a questionnaire, including questions on the assessment
   of their self-preserving behavior. Results. The prevalence of risk
   factors for health associated with lifestyle - smoking, regularity and
   quality of food, physical activity. To preserve their own health, the
   majority of respondents (55\%) consider a healthy lifestyle to be
   determined, but the practice of self-preserving behavior is not widely
   spread. Regular meals (at least three times a day) were noted by 51.3\%
   of respondents. The share of respondents, regularly (every day) engaged
   in physical culture and sports, was 27\%. The territorial
   differentiation of inhabited localities of Untsukul region is revealed
   by the prevalence of factors of self-preserving behavior. Conclusion.
   The obtained information on the way of life of residents of the Untsukul
   district can be used in the development of medical and social programs
   aimed at improving the quality of life of the population, creating a
   culture of self-preserving behavior.},

Abstract = {The work is devoted to the estimation of microalgae resource potential
   for bio-oil production. We propose a method of climate and
   infrastructural factors spatial analysis for estimations of resource and
   the possibility of bio-oil production facilities construction in the
   study region. The resource potential depends on the area of the
   territory that can be used to produce biomass as feedstock for biofuel
   production, and equal to the amount of microalgae biomass that can be
   obtained on this territory. For the case study we selected the territory
   of the Republic of Dagestan (Russia) and microalgae Arthrospira
   platensis and Dunaliella salina. As an infrastructural factors, which
   may reduce the cost of bio-oil production we considered the following
   sources of cheap material resources and energy: seawater (as a source of
   macro- and microelements), geothermal water (as low-temperature heat
   source), CO2 emissions of cement plants and combined heat and power
   plants (as carbon source and to reduce CO2 emission). The analyses of
   these factors using the technology of geoinformation systems allowed to
   find the most suitable territories for microalgae plant allocation and
   therefore estimate resource potential for bio-oil production with
   maximum profit.},

Abstract = {A recent study in 2019-2020 assessed the productivity, the quality of
   fatty and essential oils, and the mineral composition of eight nigella
   genotypes at the Federal State Budget Scientific Institution (FSBSI),
   Research Institute of Agriculture of Crimea, Simferopol, Russia. Of the
   eight genotypes, two cultivars originated from Crimea, Russia (Nigella
   sativa cv. `Krymchanka,' and Nigella damascena cv. `Yalita'), and one
   each from six European-Asian countries, i.e., Dagestan, Uzbekistan, and
   Sweden (Nigella sativa), Pakistan and India (Nigella indica), and
   Belgium (Nigella damascena). The Russian nigella genotypes served as
   control. Genotypes from three European-Asian countries (Sweden,
   Pakistan, and Dagestan) distinguished from the rest by their highest
   seed productivity, i.e., 1.0-1.6 g plant-1, which was 1.7-2.7 times
   higher than the control cultivar `Krymchanka.' The seed productivity of
   the genotype N. damascena cv. `Yalita' control was 1.5 times greater
   than the nigella genotype from Belgium. The N. indica produced the
   highest fatty oil content (29.9\%), which exceeded two other species,
   i.e., N. sativa and N. damascena by 16\%-22\%. Fatty oils of nigella
   also contained essential oils of 0.5\% for N. sativa and 1.2\% for N.
   damascena. The essential oil of N. sativa contained dominant components,
   such as, p-cymene (53.5\%) and thymoquinone (19.2\%), while N. damascena
   contained p-cymol (82.2\%) and other principal components. The
   identified samples with the maximum accumulation of fatty and essential
   oils, and macro and microelements can be used to treat and replenish the
   deficient elements in the human body. Nigella genotype samples exhibited
   high accumulation of microelements, viz., potassium, calcium, manganese,
   iron, copper, zinc, and molybdenum in the leaves and seeds.},

Title = {Historical and areal Aspects of Natural Resource Terminology in East
   Caucasian languages},
Journal = {IRAN AND THE CAUCASUS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {295-320},
Abstract = {The present paper discusses the historical background of selected terms
   in the world of East Caucasian languages that are related to the domain
   of metallurgy (copper, iron, tin, plumb, gold, and silver) augmented by
   terms for `coal' and `salt'. A closer inspection of these terms shows
   that none of them can be reconstructed for Proto-East Caucasian. Rather,
   we have to deal either with terms that have been coined in the
   intermediate protolanguages (Nakh, Avar-Andian, Tsezian, Lezgian, Lak,
   Dargwa, and Khinalug) or with more or less recent loans stemming mainly
   from the Iranian and Turkic languages. The absence of reconstructable
   terms for the items under review suggests that the speakers of the East
   Caucasian proto-language had not been involved expressively in
   metallurgic traditions (as opposed to farming traditions). Tentatively,
   these speakers can thus be associated with the early farming culture
   within the complex of the Kuro-Araxes Culture. Only after the
   proto-language disintegrated due to the migration of most of its
   speakers in the Dagestan and the regions of Chechnya, some societies
   related to these intermediate proto-languages must have been involved
   more expressively in metallurgic traditions. The more recent loans, e.g.
   for copper, gold, and silver, stemming from Iranian (Persian) and Turkic
   (Kumyk and Azeri) illustrate a shift in conceptualising these objects:
   They were now interpreted as artifacts (rather than as natural
   resources) that were associated with the cultures of the dominant
   `Oriental' societies. The paper can be seen as a preliminary study
   concerning the areal distribution of lexical patterns in the Eastern
   Caucasus from a historical perspective.},

Title = {Ecological and epidemiological features of the distribution of

Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {152-158},
Abstract = {Aim. To study the ecological and epidemiological features of the spread
   of toxoplasmosis in the territory of the Republic of Dagestan.
   Material and Methods. A total of 3152 people in the 7-50 years age range
   living in Makhachkala, Kaspiysk, Derbent and rural settlements of
   different climatic and geographical zones of the republic, were examined
   for toxoplasmosis. Among those surveyed were 1817 women and 82 children.
   Disease with toxoplasmosis was diagnosed according to laboratory and
   clinical and epidemiological data. Of the serological research methods,
   RIF (immunofluorescence reaction) and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay) were used. Based on the survey results, ecological and
   epidemiological maps were complied
   Results. It was revealed that the inhabitants of lowlands are 1,7 times
   more likely to be infected with toxoplasmosis than mountain settlements.
   The unequal frequency of toxoplasmosis infection in residents of
   mountainous and foothill areas depends not only on the altitude of the
   area above sea level, but also on soil moisture (plains and foothills),
   the intensity of isolation (highlands), as well as contact with infected
   domestic and agricultural animals. Infection with toxoplasma invasion in
   different territories varied within the range of 17.3\%-29.1\%.
   Conclusion. Identification of the sources of toxopiasma invasion was
   undertaken structured around regionally-oriented methods for the
   prevention of the disease. Typifying the sources of toxoplasmosis
   included monitoring: levels of sanitation when in contact with
   insufficiently thermally processed food products; obligatory hand
   washing after working with the soil; contact with pets; special sanitary
   and veterinary control over persons in contact with animals, as well as
   sanitary and medical care of patients and pregnant women.},

Title = {Polymorphism of <i>GH</i>/<i>HaeIII</i> and <i>GDF9</i>/<i>AsplEI</i>
   genes, genetic variation and association of their genotypes with immune
   status in sheep of different breeds ranched in different natural and

Abstract = {Aim. One of the important tasks in solving the problem of improving the
   efficiency of sheep breeding is the rational use of fodder lands in the
   North Caucasus and the South of Russia, a significant part of which is
   located in different natural and climatic conditions. The complexity of
   solutions lies in insufficient knowledge of the mechanisms of adaptation
   of farm animals, in particular sheep, to the ecological and geographical
   features of these regions. The purpose of this research was to study the
   genetic polymorphism of genes, the degree of genetic variability and
   immune status in sheep of different breeds, since genetic polymorphism
   is a measure of its adaptability and the hematopoietic function of blood
   is the basis of the life of the organism.
   Material and Methods. The genetic structure of the GH/Hae III,
   GDF9/AsplEI genes and immune status, was studied by the methods of
   genetic-statistical and immune analysis in sheep of different breeds
   kept in different climatic zones of Dagestan and the Krasnodar
   Territory.
   Results. As a result of DNA genotyping of the studied samples of sheep
   of different breeds, it was found that polymorphism of GH/HaeIII,
   GDWAsplEI genes is represented by three genotype variants: homozygous
   GH/HaeIII(AA), GH/HaeIII(BB); GDF9/AsplEI(AA), GDF9/AsplEI(GG);
   heterozygous GH/HaeIII(AB); GDF9/AsplEI(AG) and two alleles: A and B -
   of the GH/HaeIII gene; A and G - GDF9/AsplEI gene with different
   frequency of occurrence, respectively.
   Conclusion. For the first time, genetic variability has been studied in
   the context of the immune status of sheep populations of different
   breeds bred in the foothills of the Republic of Dagestan and Krasnodar
   Territory. The information obtained about the role of the degree of
   genetic variability and the immune status of sheep of different breeds
   is answered in the formation of adaptive-compensatory mechanisms to
   specific conditions of the breeding environment. A deeper study of the
   adaptive characteristics of sheep of different breeds for their further
   improvement allows the use of molecular genetic and hematological
   methods.},

Abstract = {The relevance of the study of mycoses is increasing due to their
   widespread distribution. Field experiments were carried out on sites in
   the region with short daylight hours (Dagestan) and long daylight hours
   (Volgograd). Fungal diseases were investigated on crops with short
   daylight hours: cucumber, pepper, and cotton according to the methods
   generally accepted in phytopathology. The species composition of
   aboriginal and exotic infections was revealed. Each culture under
   conditions of long daylight hours is characterized by damage by 4-5
   species of fungi. The manifestation of exotic infections is observed at
   the beginning of the growing season at the seedling stage. The role of
   the introduction of short-day plants to the northern regions in the
   spread of exotic species of pathogenic fungi is shown. The species
   composition of fungi on crops in the study areas was found to be
   identical. They belong to different biological groups, but saprotrophs,
   biotrophs and hemibiotrophs predominate. It was found that Fusarium
   lolii (Wm.G. Sm.) Sacc and Rhizoctonia solani Kuehn (on cotton) and
   Verticillium dahliae Kleb and Rhizoctonia solani J.G. moved to new areas
   together with seeds. Kuhn (on pepper). These species are capable of
   causing epiphytotics at the beginning of the growing season with a low
   natural infectious background. The accumulation of native species of
   infection in the lands adjacent to the fields during the cultivation
   period leads to the appearance of epiphytoties in the second half of the
   growing season. First of all, the assimilation apparatus, flowers,
   ovaries and fruits are affected.},

Abstract = {The ecology of the species was studied in Daghestan throughout all the
   seasons from 1986 to 1993.  Two main factors determine the number and
   distribution of turs:  1) inaccessibility of habitats (rocky and steep
   mountain slopes), the area of main ranges:  2) feeding conditions and
   first of all the area and productivity of winter pastures.  The highest
   population density of turs was observed on the spurs of large
   mountain-masses, which are more than 7-10 km long and more than 4000 m
   high.  The population density of turs varies in different regions from
   1,8 to 7,3 animals per 100 ha., their total number is about 20 000
   animals which is more than 2-2,5 times as high as noted in former papers
   concerning this species.
   The study revealed, that in the areas, which are not intensively used
   for agriculture, the average winter density of the populations in
   different localities of the area is stable (31 to 35 animals per 100
   ha.).  Probably, it is determined by carrying capacity of winter
   pastures and reflects the maximum number of a population.  In areas,
   where the degree of exploitation of winter pastures by cattle exceed
   80\%, the population density of turs reduces and does not exceed 11.5 to
   15.3 animals per 100 ha.  That can be attributed to the consumption of
   some part of vegetation by sheep.},

Abstract = {In Islam, saint worship (awliya) is a problem for both the Muslim
   scholars (ulema) and academics specialized in Mid-Eastern studies. Its
   characteristics during the post-Soviet era are identified in the attempt
   to review modern approaches to studying the late 20th-century Islamic
   revival in the northern Caucasus. Data collected among the Rutul, a
   small group dwelling in the mountains of southern Dagestan, shed light
   on the meaning of Muslim religiosity at the microsocial level of a
   kolkhoz or rural clan. Focus is placed: on the types of shrines in the
   Samur Valley, their architecture and rites; on legends about the sheikhs
   buried there; and on the social functions of these shrines and their
   relation to Sufism. Muslim practices among the Rutul during the
   post-Soviet era are hybrid. They are not remnants from a pre-Islamic
   past; nor are they related to the rites of Sufi brotherhoods. They are
   evidence of the overall transformation of local Muslim society due to
   modern secular reforms. To better delimit the post-Soviet patchwork of
   religions, we must abandon once and for all simplistic contrasts between
   traditional and modern Islam, between an Islam of the Book and popular
   Islam.},

Abstract = {Local grape cultivars from different countries of the world are an
   important part of the gene pool of this culture. Of particular interest
   are the genotypes of the most ancient regions of viticulture. The
   territories of the subtropical zone of Georgia and the central part of
   Abkhazia belong to one of the centers of origin of the cultural
   grapevine. The purpose of the work was to genotype native Abkhazian
   grape cultivars, to study their genetic diversity based on DNA profiling
   data and to compare them with the genotypes of local varieties of other
   viticultural regions. Samples of plants were taken on the territory of
   the Republic of Abkhazia in private farmsteads and in the collection of
   the agricultural firm ``Vina i Vody Abkhazii{''} ({''}Wines and Waters
   of Abkhazia{''}).The genotyping of the Abkhazian cultivars Avasirhva,
   Agbizh, Azhapsh, Azhizhkvakva, Azhikvaca, Atvizh, Atyrkuazh, Achkykazh,
   Kachich was carried out using 14 DNA markers, 9 of which are standard
   microsatellite markers recommended for the identification of grape
   varieties. To improve our knowledge about the sizes of the identified
   alleles, we used the DNA of grape cultivars with a known allelic
   composition at the analyzed loci. Statistical analysis of the data
   showed that the observed heterozygosity for the analyzed loci exceeded
   expected values, which indicates a genetic polymorphism of the studied
   sample of varieties. Evaluation of genetic similarity within the
   analyzed group based on the results of genotyping at 14 loci showed that
   the cultivars Kachich and Azhapsh differed from the other Abkhazian
   varieties. The obtained DNA profiles of the Abkhazian cultivars were
   checked for compliance with DNA-fingerprints of grape varieties in the
   Vitis International Variety Catalogue. The Georgian varieties
   Azhizhkvakva and Tsitska turned out to be synonyms according to DNA
   profiles, two varieties from the Database (Italian Albana bianca and
   Georgian Ojaleshi) have differences in DNA fingerprints from the
   varieties Atyrkuazh and Azhikvatsa only in one allele, respectively.
   When comparing the identified Abkhazian grape genotypes, their
   difference from the sample of Dagestan, Don, Greek, Turkish, Italian,
   Spanish, and French varieties and genetic similarity with the genotypes
   of Georgian grapes were shown.},

Abstract = {Two geographers report on the current challenges facing the inhabitants
   of the Caucasus mountains on the borders of Russia and its southern
   neighbors, Georgia and Azerbaijan. The authors discuss the impacts of
   new post-Soviet borders and controls as well as unresolved conflicts in
   Nagorno-Karabakh, Chechnya, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and the Prigorodnyy
   district of North Ossetia, which have disrupted traditional ways of life
   and forced the peoples of the mountains to migrate or adjust their
   economic activities. Based on extensive field work in 2005-2006, and in
   the 1990s, they detect some signs of improvement in the new privatized
   environment after the difficult years of transition. However, the weak
   infrastructure of the region, combined with the high costs associated
   with development and modernization of peripheral locations, suggest that
   resettlement from the high mountains to the cities on the plains and
   piedmont is likely to continue.},

Abstract = {Aim. Determination of the importance of the ecological vector in
   ensuring the sustainable development of the Republic of Dagestan.
   Materials and Methods. A historical and comparative analysis was carried
   out using official statistical data of Rosstat and data from state
   reports on the state and on environmental protection.
   Results. The author proposes that there be a focus on the formation of
   public and individual ecological consciousness of citizens, the
   involvement of the population in various environmental actions, the use
   of alternative energy sources and the development of tourism in the
   republic, taking into account the proper level of protection of natural
   objects.
   Conclusion. The Republic of Dagestan, due to its geographical and
   climatic features, has more potential in the field of sustainable
   development than any other region of our country, but it seems that the
   best results require the application of all the actions listed herein
   aimed at strengthening the role of the environmental component of
   sustainable development.},

Abstract = {Locusts and grasshoppers are dangerous polyphagous pests of agricultural
   crops. In the present paper, results of screening of Acridoidea
   populations in the South-Western Russia for microsporidia infections
   including locusts Locusta migratoria, Dociostaurus maroccanus, and
   Calliptamus italicus and grasshoppers Chorthippus loratus, Oedipoda
   caerulescens, and Acrida bicolor, are presented. Microsporidia
   prevalence rates were estimated using light microscopy of fresh smears.
   Out of 179 specimens of L. migratoria sampled between 2002 and 2019 in
   Krasnodar Territory, Astrakhan and Rostov Regions, none was infected
   with microsporidia. Similarly, 95 specimens of D. marrocanus from
   Krasnodar Territory (2017) and Dagestan Republic (2009) were also
   negative for microsporidia. Meanwhile, one positive case was detected
   for C. italicus corresponding to 0.5 \% for the total amount of 192
   exemplars collected from 2002 to 2019 in Krasnodar Territory, Astrakhan
   and Rostov Regions. As for grasshoppers, all Ch. loratus samplings in
   Krasnodar Territory in 2017-2019 were infected at the prevalence rates
   of 2.2-15 \%, though no infection was found in 40 specimens in Crimea in
   2019. In 56 individuals of O. caerulescens collected from Rostov Region
   and Krasnodar Territory, the microsporidia prevalence rate was 1.8 \%.
   Among 96 specimens of A. bicolor, none was infected. In total, the
   microsporidia prevalence rates were higher in grasshoppers as compared
   to locusts, the difference being statistically significant at p<0.01.},

Abstract = {Galactomannan (gum), a water-soluble polysaccharide, is widely used as a
   gelling agent in liquids, including in the oil and gas industry for
   hydraulic fracturing. The most effective source of this valuable plant
   material is seeds of guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub.), a legume
   crop new for Russia. Although in recent years progress has been made in
   the selection of guar varieties adapted to the conditions of the Russian
   Federation, the question of the most appropriate region for the
   cultivation of this crop remains open. The purpose of the study was to
   investigate how a region and technology of guar cultivation can affect
   the main indicators of the final target product: the content and
   viscosity of guar gum extracted from the seeds of various guar
   genotypes. To understand this, ecogeographical tests of 13 guar
   accessions from the VIR collection were conducted at the experimental
   stations of the Vavilov Institute (VIR), where climatic conditions
   correspond to the temperature requirements of the crop. To compare the
   properties of gum extracted from the seeds of various genotypes, a
   fast-tracked laboratory method was suggested allowing gum extracts to be
   obtained for assessing their viscosity. The method allows fast screening
   of the breeding material and selecting guar genotypes with beneficial
   properties of guar gum which are in demand by the oil industry. Applying
   the fast laboratory method for assessing the properties of gum in seeds
   of 13 guar varieties showed that the content and viscosity of gum of the
   same variety vary greatly depending on growing conditions. The same set
   of 13 guar accessions was grown in 2018 at the Volgograd, Astrakhan,
   Dagestan and Kuban VIR experimental stations. As a result, the maximum
   viscosity values were obtained for the seeds reproduced at the Astrakhan
   region, where the guar was grown on irrigated lands. On the other hand,
   the maximum gum content in the seeds of all accessions was recorded when
   they were grown in the Volgograd region. The results showed that the
   guar gum extracted from seeds of guar plants grown in the Russian
   Federation can be used as a gelling agent in the processes of
   intensification of oil production by the method of hydraulic fracturing.
   This experience is new to the Russian Federation.},

Title = {Post-Soviet Transformations in Pastoral Systems in the North Caucasus:

Abstract = {This article describes the condition and spread of one of the most
   mobile forms of pastoralism, transhumance, as well as factors and
   transition pathways that have taken place in the pastoral systems of the
   North Caucasus. The weakening of centralization and control over local
   economies, as well as the cessation of subsidies to collective and state
   farms in the 1990s, led to the destruction of state-regulated
   transhumance. At the same time, traditional institutions and local forms
   of social organization, such as ethnic groups, tribal alliances, and
   family associations, are playing an important role. This study is based
   on mapping of pasture use, analysis of statistical data, and interviews
   with shepherds, municipal authority representatives, and government
   officials from regional agricultural departments. It describes the
   factors promoting or limiting transhumance in 4 regions (Dagestan,
   Chechnya, North Ossetia-Alania, and Karachay-Cherkessia), including
   ethnicity, land tenure, the status of privatization of agricultural
   land, and centralization of power. Leading actors and institutions in 3
   periods, pre-Revolutionary, Soviet, and post-Soviet, are considered,
   with a more detailed analysis of the last period right up to present
   times. The role of resettlement of people from the mountains to the
   plains in the Soviet period, which contributed to the development of
   transhumance in the modern period, is emphasized. institutional hybrids
   are discussed, including formal state and informal (traditional and new)
   rules to regulate the use of pastures during the transition from the
   Soviet central planning system to market relations.},

Abstract = {Aim. The rational use of North Caucasus forage lands, a large part of
   which is located in the mountains, is one of the important tasks in
   addressing the issue of improving the efficiency of cattle breeding.
   This appears quite challenging, as the mechanisms of adaptation of farm
   animals, in particular cattle, to the environmental and climatic
   peculiarities of a certain region have not been sufficiently explored.
   Since hematopoietic function of blood is the basis of organism's vital
   functions and genetic polymorphism is the measure of its adaptability,
   the present study is aimed at examining haematological profile and the
   degree of genetic variation in the Brown Caucasian cattle.
   Materials and Methods. Haematological, genetic and statistical methods
   of analysis were used to examine the haematological profile and genetic
   structure of genes GH, PIT-1, PRL in Brown Caucasian dairy cattle, bred
   in different ecological and climatic zones of Dagestan.
   Conclusion. This was the first time that hematopoietic function was
   studied in the context of genetic variation in Brown Caucasian dairy
   cattle bred in the foothills (100-200 m above sea level) and mountains
   (650-1,250 m above sea level). The information obtained gives an idea of
   and an answer to the question about the role of haematological profile
   and the degree of genetic variation in the development of adaptive and
   compensatory mechanisms to specific environmental conditions. The use of
   haematological, molecular and genetic methods allows the further
   exploration of the adaptation traits of Brown Caucasian dairy cattle for
   their further improvement.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the negative problems of financial policies of
   municipalities caused by external, rather than financial reasons. It
   analyses field researches held in 2009-2012 in the Republic of Dagestan,
   Altai Krai, Tverskaya oblast, Ivanovskaya oblast, Kirovskaya oblast,
   Kostramskaya oblast, Smolenskaya oblast. They all belong to the group of
   endowments. There were 21 municipalities that participated in the
   research: 5 city circuits, 7 municipal districts, 8 rural settlements
   and 1 urban settlement.
   The research singled out the main non-financial reasons for ineffective
   management of finances at the municipal level such as: (1) peculiarities
   of the developed system of real relationships between the state and
   municipal authorities; (2) negative impact of personal features of the
   head of the municipality on the quality of management; (3) municipal
   bureaucrats lack any stimulus to increase the revenue base.
   Recommendations: state bodies of power should heed the opinion and
   support initiatives of local authorities to increase financial security.
   To stimulate municipalities for increasing their own revenues, it is
   necessary that state programs for the promotion of more successful
   municipalities into regions that have no such programs should be
   adopted. Such programs must stimulate developing of the depressive
   municipalities without decreasing stimuli to develop in the successful
   municipalities. Besides, it necessary regions should develop cooperation
   and exchange positive experience in this field.},

Title = {Analysis of the Impact of Species Composition, Projective Cover, and

Abstract = {The intensification of pasture degradation in the southern part of
   European Russia, which is caused by unfavorable hydrothermal conditions
   and unregulated livestock numbers, requires the development of
   approaches to assess the capacity of forage lands using Earth remote
   sensing methods. The spectral reflectance properties of vegetation are
   determined by its taxonomic, structural, phenological, biophysical, and
   biochemical characteristics. However, the patterns of how these
   parameters affect the spectral response are region-specific and heavily
   influenced by soil cover. Therefore, it is essential to expand the
   regional scope of studies on the spectral reflectance properties of
   various vegetation types. This research is devoted to determining the
   spectral reflectance properties of natural zonal pastures in southern
   European Russia, based on geobotanical investigations and field
   spectrometry using the PSR-1100f instrument within the 320-1100 nm
   range. Groundwork was carried out in May (the period of maximum green
   mass of vegetation) 2020-2022 in the territories of natural zonal
   pastures in Astrakhan and Volgograd oblasts, Stavropol krai, and the
   Republics of Dagestan and Kalmykia. Significant differences were found
   between feather grasses, semishrubs, and annuals in the visible and
   near-ultraviolet spectral regions. Changes in the projective cover,
   under other equal conditions, have the most significant impact on
   spectral properties in the 660-670 nm range, which is consistent with
   the results of other researchers. Vegetation indices were identified
   that are best suited for determining projective cover and above-ground
   biomass of pastures with various dominant species. Further research will
   enable transitioning from point measurements of spectral reflectance and
   structural vegetation characteristics to satellite data with different
   spatial resolutions.},

Abstract = {A study of the influence of farming practices in the Middle Ages (X-XV
   AD) on the activities of 11 hydrolytic enzymes involved in the
   biogeochemical cycles of major elements in soils has been carried out.
   Agrostratozems of Medieval agricultural terraces in Dagestan mountains
   (Plaggic and Hortic Anthrosols) were chosen as objects of study. In all
   cases, the enzymatic activity of the studied soils decreased in all soil
   layers in the following sequence: alkaline phosphatase >
   phosphodiesterase > acid phosphatase > pyrophosphatase >= leucine
   aminopeptidase > arylsulfatase > chitinase > beta-glucosidase > xylanase
   > alpha-glucosidase > cellobiohydrolase. The enzymatic activity of the
   studied soils was primarily determined by the amount of microbial
   biomass (C-mic). Thus, the activity of enzymes of various groups
   depended on C-mic by 61-94\%. Agricultural practices associated with
   ploughing, manuring, and irrigation induce the convergence in the
   activity of nitrogen cycle enzymes in soils of the mountain zone, which
   is associated with similar features of the nitrogen cycle in agrogenic
   soils, regardless of bioclimatic conditions. The addition of organic
   materials has led to an increase in the physiological efficiency of
   microbial communities and the rate of enzyme production, and high levels
   of biological activity can persist in soil for about 1000 years.
   Ploughing with the application of organic fertilizers in the past led to
   an increase in enzymatic activity expressed per unit of microbial
   biomass (specific activity), therefore, this indicator can be used as an
   indicator of agrogenic transformation of soils in the past.},

Abstract = {The annual legume crop clusterbean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub.)
   is a promising crop for cultivation in the south of Russia. In 2018,
   phytosanitary examinations of clusterbean fields (13 collection
   accessions) were conducted in five VIR branches (Krasnodar Territory,
   Dagestan, Astrakhan and Volgograd Regions). At all points, several types
   of leaf spots were observed on clusterbean leaves and symptoms of plant
   damage by fungi of the genus Alternaria Nees prevailed. Using
   microbiological methods and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) of the
   nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer two (ITS2), the species
   composition of micromycetes was identified. It was found that the
   micromycetes Alternaria spp. in different ecological and geographical
   conditions of the south of Russia cause two main types of leaf spots:
   the typical (beige and brown round spots, usually accompanied by
   concentric zonality) and brown spot (small brown bulging merging spots).
   Overwhelmingly the damage to leaf tissues is caused by the fungus A.
   tenuissima (Nees \& T. Nees : Fr.) Wiltshire. A quite numerous
   accompanying mycoflora (first of all, fungi of the genus Fusarium Link)
   was also detected. A. cyamopsidis Rangaswami \& A.V. Rao, one of the
   most harmful guar pathogens in the countries where the main acreage is
   located (India, Pakistan, USA), was not found on clusterbean fields in
   Russia. The accessions of clusterbean differ in degree of damage by A.
   tenuissima that causes Alternaria leaf blight. Differential interaction
   of parasite and plant host was revealed. Therefore, to prevent
   epiphytotics, varieties protected by non-identical resistance genes
   should be grown. At all VIR branches, accessions k-52568 (Argentina) and
   k-52569 (Pakistan) were weakly damaged by Alternaria leaf blight, and
   some accessions were resistant only in the environmental conditions of
   one or two experimental stations. The accessions studied were
   heterogeneous in pathogen resistance, which allows selecting
   disease-resistant lines from most of the collection accessions. Thus, in
   various VIR branches, plants without symptoms of disease were selected
   from accessions k-52571, k-52573 and k-52580, and seeds were collected
   to create new donors of disease resistance.},

Abstract = {Studying of economic transformations in RSFSR regions, including
   Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (hereinafter referred to
   as DASSR),during their integration with neighboring state formations in
   the most difficult period of modernization of the state system is one of
   the most important areas in establishment of the modern strategy of
   Russian economic development. The studied issue is important because no
   analysis of facts evidencing the process of DASSR integration into the
   common Russian economic space has been performed yet in spite of its
   necessity. The main purpose of this article is a brief analysis of the
   history of establishment of economic relations of the Republic of
   Dagestan with RSFSR regions in 1985-1991. The said issue was studied
   with regard to a cause-to-effect and in-sequence considering the
   principles of objectivity and a historical method by means of methods of
   logical data synthesis, retrospective review, and comparative analysis
   of events of historic reality. Besides, statistical, analytic, and
   induction research methods were applied to reflect the changing indexes
   of the depth of Dagestani integration into the Russian space more
   accurately and visually. The process of development of economic contacts
   founded in the North-Caucasian Economic Region in the environment of the
   state system modernization is tracked in the article based on new
   archive materials, periodicals and Internet data. Causes and reasons of
   their establishment were described, the enterprises participating in the
   economic exchange were indicated, and the list of exchanged products was
   represented. The rate of the process of republican interaction the with
   Russian enterprises was analyzed, and the extent of their co-dependence
   was determined. The article may be useful for both historian and
   economist researches and officers of ministries and authorities to
   design a future strategy of economic development of the Republic of
   Dagestan and Russia in general.},

Title = {Maternal Origins and Haplotype Diversity of Seven Russian Goat
   Populations Based on the D-loop Sequence Variability},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Russia has diverse specifically selected and multipurpose
   goat resources. However, the origin of the local goats is still
   enigmatic. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) fragments of seven Russian local goat populations to provide the
   first insight into their maternal lineage. The territory of modern
   Russia lies on the crossroads of East and West and covers various
   geographical environments where diverse groups of local goats
   originated. In this work, we present the first study on the maternal
   origin of Russian local goats, including Altai Mountain (n= 9), Dagestan
   Downy (n= 18), Dagestan Local (n= 12), Dagestan Milk (n= 15), Karachaev
   (n= 21), Orenburg (n= 10), and Soviet Mohair (n= 7) breeds, based on 715
   bp D-loop mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences. Saanen goats (n= 5) were
   used for comparison. Our findings reveal a high haplotype (HD =
   0.843-1.000) and nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.0112-0.0261). A total of
   59 haplotypes were determined in the Russian goat breeds, in which all
   differed from the haplotypes of the Saanen goats. The haplotypes
   identified in Altai Mountain, Orenburg, Soviet Mohair, and Saanen goats
   were breed specific. Most haplotypes (56 of 59) were clustered together
   with samples belonging to haplogroup A, which was in accordance with the
   global genetic pattern of maternal origin seen in most goats worldwide.
   The haplotypes that were grouped together with rare haplogroups D and G
   were found in the Altai Mountain breed and haplogroup C was detected in
   the Soviet Mohair breed. Thus, our findings revealed that local goats
   might have been brought to Russia via various migration routes. In
   addition, haplotype sharing was found in aboriginal goat populations
   from overlapping regions, which might be useful information for their
   official recognition status.},

Abstract = {Aim. To test the effectiveness and environmental friendliness of a new
   method of biothermal treatment of bird litter and disinfectant -
   Penoks-2 - in relation to bird coccidia oocysts. Material and Methods. A
   test of biothermal disinfection of bedding manure and disinfestation of
   premises for rearing young laying hens (6000 birds), was carried out in
   the Mugutdinova farm of the Buynaksky district of the Republic of
   Dagestan. The detection of coccidia oocysts was carried out according to
   the method of Void and Darling, Methods for the Laboratory Diagnosis of
   Avian Coccidiosis{''}. The quality of the disinfestation using Penox-2
   solutions was controlled by examining swabs and scrapings taken from the
   experimental and control surfaces of the premises in accordance with the
   Rules for Disinfection and Disinfestation of Objects of State Veterinary
   Supervision. The study of biothermal processes in the litter manure was
   carried out every 5 days with temperature measurement of piles, while
   taking samples of the litter for detecting the presence of coccidia
   oocysts. Results. The studies conducted established that the most
   environmentally safe method of disinfecting premises is biothermal where
   the population of replacement laying hens is kept. The temperature in
   piles 1.5 and 2.0 m high and 2-2.5 m wide reached 65-75 \& DEG;C on the
   20-25th day, which ensures the destruction of coccidia oocysts.
   Production tests have shown that solutions of the new Penox-2 agent
   destroy coccidia oocysts in the external environment after irrigation of
   room surfaces with a content of 3.0\% chloramine B through a single
   application at the rate of 0.5 l/m2 and 3 hours exposure. Conclusion.
   Tests of a new method of biothermal treatment of litter manure and
   disinfestation with solutions of Penox-2 showed high efficiency and
   environmental safety in the destruction of coccidia oocysts.},

Title = {ARIDITY: FORMS OF MANIFESTATION AND INFLUENCE ON THE STEPPE ZONE

Abstract = {This paper is an attempt to consider historical processes in Eastern
   European desert-steppe zone in the Bronze Age in the context of
   correlation between the economic pattern and the changing environment.
   Geographically the study is confined to the southern part of the
   Volgograd oblast, almost the entire Republic of Kalmykia, the eastern
   districts of the Stavropol Region and the northeastern districts of the
   Republic of Daghestan, and chronologically to the late Middle Bronze
   Age, the post-Catacomb period and the early Late Bronze Age. Up to now
   palaeoecological reconstructions have not been taking into account the
   influence of the variation of annual precipitation on the economy of
   early societies. A conjugate analysis of the evolution of the Bronze Age
   cultures and the dynamics of the environment enabled us to ascertain
   that the survival of early pastoralists in the desert-steppe zone
   depended primarily on climate conditions of the cold period, i.e. on the
   amount and forms of winter precipitation. The increasing climate aridity
   in the desert-steppe zone around the turn of the 2nd millennium BC was
   due to the intensification of the winter anticyclone having led to the
   contraction of the volume of precipitation in the cold year period. In
   these conditions cold dry weather with a thin snow layer or its total
   lack particularly suitable for winter grazing sets in. It was against
   such a climatic background that the Lola culture based on small cattle,
   sheep and goat keeping evolved. The reverse process, i.e. the decrease
   of the winter anticyclone in the 18th-17th centuries BC, led to the
   increase of precipitation, frequent snowstorms, ice-covered grass, the
   formation of ice crust and the thickening of the snow layer. In such
   conditions the number of days suitable for grazing decreases and
   consequently the livestock is subject to weakening and sicknesses which
   may bring about its total loss. It seems likely that this was the reason
   of a gradual deterioration of post-Catacomb cultures of the
   desert-steppe zone. On the whole, the well-known gaps in the desert
   steppe exploitation in the Bronze Age correlated with the optimization
   of natural conditions while the period of the increasing climate aridity
   saw the heyday of early pastoralism.},

Abstract = {Feeding and spatial distribution of Caucasian chamois and domestic sheep
   were studied in the eastern Caucasus. Trophic analysis showed that the
   chamois diet consisted of 12 herbaceous species and 21 for sheep.
   Chamois selected forbs and fabaceous species, whereas sheep foraged less
   selectively. The trophic niche breadth (averaged) of sheep was
   significantly greater (9.75) than that of chamois (4.33). Trophic niche
   overlap reached 86\% in spring and 56.6\% in autumn, and the summer
   spatial niche breadth of chamois was lower (0.83) than that of sheep
   (1.46). The spatial niche overlapping of both species was low (17\%).
   Five environmental parameters made the highest contributions to
   interspecific differences. Chamois habitats in spring were characterised
   by a lower total phytomass level and higher-calorie herbaceous group
   biomass (forbs, fabaceous) than in sheep-grazing areas, whereas in
   autumn, the high-calorie herbaceous-group biomass was higher in chamois
   habitats than in sheep pastures. We deduce that the chamois spatial
   pattern is a potential response to sheep presence; chamois moves to
   difficult-to-reach habitats. Therefore, ecological segregation could be
   potentially expected due to divergence along the spatial axis of the
   ecological niche.},

Abstract = {At the moment, a relevant objective in pharmacognosy, is the use of all
   kinds of the DNA analysis methods for identifying plant materials,
   detecting counterfeits, genetically modified crops and products.
   The aim of the research is to study the possibility of using molecular
   genetic research methods in the analysis of the genus Hedysarum L., for
   the identification of medicinal plant materials. This article presents
   the results of the application of molecular genetic research methods in
   the analysis of the genus Hedysarum L. in the flora of the North
   Caucasus.
   Materials and methods. The study material was the samples of the genus
   Hedysarum L species collected in the North Caucasus: Hedysarum
   caucasicum M. Bieb. (in the fruiting phase in the territory of the
   Karachay-Cherkess Republic); Hedysarum grandiflorum Pall. (in the
   fruiting phase in the Volgograd region); Hedysarum daghestanicum Rupr.
   ex Boiss. (in the flowering phase in the Republic of Dagestan).
   Sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-IT52 marker region of gene 5.8S by the RNA
   ribosome was carried out according to the Sanger method on the AbiPrism
   3130 genetic analyzer at the laboratory of biosystematics and cytology
   of Komarov Botanical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
   Results. Based on a comparative study of the marker region of the
   nuclear ribosomal gene 5.8S rRNA, marker nucleotide substitutions of
   Hedysarum caucasicum M. Bieb., Hedysarum daghestanicum Rupr. ex Boiss.,
   Hedysarum grandiflorum Pall, have been identified. The most probable
   secondary structure of 5.85 rRNA has been constructed. It has been shown
   that based on the analysis performed, it is possible to predict
   additional raw material sources of mangiferin and other groups of
   xanthones using the molecular data exemplified by the Obscura section.
   Conclusion. Based on the data obtained, it can be concluded that the
   morphological classification of the genus Hedysarum L. can be confirmed
   within the Obscura section.},

Abstract = {Russia has favorable natural and climatic conditions and forage base for
   the beekeeping development. According to Russian Federal State
   Statistics Service, in 2016 the total number of bee colonies was 3.3
   million, of which 3.1 million or 94\% of the existing bee colonies were
   in private households with 78 regions out of 85 subjects of the Russian
   Federation being engaged in beekeeping. However, climate change, various
   biotic and anthropogenic factors have a negative impact on the state of
   the industry, manifested, first of all, in reducing the productivity of
   bee colonies, their quality, ability to resist diseases. Analysis of the
   results of research on bee colonies from 18 regions of the country
   (Arkhangelsk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Kirov, Leningrad, Moscow, Orenburg,
   Penza, Tomsk, Tula, and Tyumen regions; Altai, Krasnodar, Perm and
   Stavropol krais; republics of Mari El, Tatarstan, and Udmurtia) shows
   that the surveyed apiaries are affected by acariases, bacterioses,
   viroses, mycoses and microsporidioses of bees. The study of bees and
   brood samples showed viruses such as deformed wing virus (DWV), acute
   bee paralysis virus (ABPV), chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV), sacbrood
   virus (SBV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), Kashmir virus (KBV), Israeli
   acute paralysis virus (IAPV); bacteria: Paenibacillus larvae larvae,
   Melissococcus pluton, Escherichia coli; Ascosphaera apis fungus; mites
   Varroa destructor, Acarapis externus, Acarapis woodi Rennie;
   microsporidia Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae. Of the most common mixed
   infection-invasions of bees, the following can be identified:
   varroosis-nosemosis, varroosis-ascosphaerosis,
   varroosis-nosemosis-ascosphaerosis, varroosis-virosis (deformed wing
   virus), varroosis-virosis (sacbrood), varroosis-American foulbrood and
   European foulbrood. Studies conducted in Russia recent years are the
   basis for the development of a monitoring system for bee diseases in the
   country. To obtain objective data, joint efforts of scientists, the
   state veterinary service and owners of apiaries are needed. First of
   all, such kind of events should be held in regions with a large number
   of bee colonies (Altai, Krasnodar and Primorye krais; republics of
   Bashkortostan, Dagestan, Tatarstan, Udmurtia; Belgorod region.) Special
   attention should be paid to breeding farms.},

Abstract = {The qualitative composition and quantitative content of mineral
   substances in the soils and fruits of Prunus armeniaca L. and Malus
   domestica Borkh. cultivated in the environmental conditions of the
   plains and foothills of central Daghestan has been estimated. The
   adaptation of apricot and apple trees to the natural factors of the
   lower foothills results in higher sugar concentrations in their fruits
   in comparison with trees growing on plains; the apricot and apple trees
   growing on lower foothills concentrate more Ca and P, while the contents
   of K, Na, Mg, and Cu in their fruits are reduced. Plants of the same
   species growing on soils with different contents of mineral substances
   differ by the total content of macro-and microelements in their fruits
   but accumulate roughly equivalent levels of P, Na, Ca, Cu, Ni, and Pb.},

Title = {Land Reforms in Post-Socialist Mountain Regions and their Impact on Land
   Use Management: a Case Study from the Caucasus},
Journal = {REVUE DE GEOGRAPHIE ALPINE-JOURNAL OF ALPINE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {105},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The land reforms of the 1990s in the former Soviet republics led to the
   elimination of the state's monopoly on the ownership of land, a revival
   in local communities and a rise in business activity. The consequences
   of these reforms include the almost total disappearance of collective
   farms and the emergence of the private ownership of land. In the 1990s,
   the state delegated political power, including the disposability of
   land, to local authorities. However, these changes in political power
   varied significantly from region to region. This article aims to explain
   the various institutional environments that have developed at the local
   level in reaction to land reforms. Our investigation of 18 key villages
   in the North Caucasus republics of Karachay-Cherkessia,
   Kabardino-Balkaria, North Ossetia, Ingushetia, Chechnya and Dagestan
   show that land reforms have galvanised multiple actors representing the
   state, as well as collectives, individuals and various formal and
   informal institutions that regulate relations between these actors.
   Along with the political factors -such as the level of centralisation
   and economic liberalisation - that have led to differences in the pace
   of land reforms, local natural and cultural conditions and communities
   play an important role. The latter are characterised either by
   conservatism or by readiness for reforms. Regarding the key villages,
   five different types were identified: 1) villages where most of the land
   has been redistributed among private owners (Karachay-Cherkessia); 2)
   villages that have preserved collective use (some settlements in the
   North Caucasus with mainly Russian population); 3) villages where access
   to land is regulated by the state (Chechnya); 4) villages where access
   to land is regulated by municipal bureaucracy at the district level
   (many other regions in the North Caucasus); and 5) villages where the
   right of access to land is in dispute between the government and the
   business and local communities (e.g. villages in the tourist areas of
   the North Caucasus).},

Title = {TO THE FAUNA OF TICKS OF THE REPUBLIC OF DAGHESTAN},
Journal = {SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {43-51},
Abstract = {Aim. The human factor has a significant influence on the development
   cycles of flora and fauna in the republic, including ticks, in which
   life cycles are associated with parasitization of agricultural animals,
   where biotopes are farm buildings, virgin and fallow pastures. Global
   changes in agriculture over the past two decades have led to an increase
   in natural pastures, reduction in the areas of sowing grasses, an
   increase in biotope areas and a number of parasitic ticks on animals. In
   this regard, we set a goal to study the ecological and biological
   features of the distribution of biotopes of arthropod parasites in the
   republic. Material and methods. The material of the study was ticks
   collected from cattle, sheep and horses in various zones. Collection of
   ticks was carried out by epizootic and regular methods. Observations,
   using the direct collection method, have been carried out for 7 years.
   Results. The researches revealed the presence of 4 genera of Ixodes
   ticks in the Republic: Hyalomma, Boophilus, Rhipicephalus and
   Dermacentor, and the genus Hyalomma occurs mainly in the Tersko-Sulak
   lowland, the rest can be discovered throughout the territory of
   Chechnya. Their species composition is represented by H. scupense, H.
   anatolicum, H. marginatum, H. plumbeum; B. annulatus; D. reticulatus, D.
   marginatus, D. daghestanicus and R. bursa. Conclusion. Through the
   infected eggs of the tick, further infection of the larvae takes place,
   which in turn, after molting, turn into the nymph and infect healthy
   animals, as well as the adult. The natural and climatic conditions of
   the Republic favor such a cycle of development of ticks.},

Abstract = {Nowadays there is much tension in the Russian modern vine growing
   industry around the issue of enhancing the range of grape varieties,
   which is aimed at production of highly adaptive grape plants and
   sustainable production of competitive grape varieties in the unstable
   stressing weather conditions of the moderate continental climate in the
   south of Russia. In this view, we believe it important to carry out
   research into the origin, generation and preservation of genetic
   resources so that they can be involved in the selection process and
   reach most important objectives of the national economy. The role of a
   variety and ampelographic collections becomes more important. The Anapa
   ampelographic collection (http://azosviv.info/category/
   osnovnye\_razdely/anapskaya\_ampelograficheskaya\_kollekciya) is
   Russia's largest gene pool depository of grape varieties brought from
   various countries of Europe, Asia and America, and Russia's regions as
   well. It contains 4921 grape varieties, including Vitis vinifera L.
   (2975), V. amurensis Rupr. (40), V. labrusca L. (50), the interspecies
   varieties V. vinifera L. x V. amurensis Rupr. (210), V. vinifera L. x V.
   labrusca L. (168), blended interspecies hybrids V. vinifera Lx hybrids
   SV (220), V. vinifera L. x V. amurensis Rupr. x hybrids SV (70), and
   other samples. We carry out extensive research into collection varieties
   for their production and selection. We select varieties and forms
   showing good agronomic characters in productivity, quality of grapes and
   wine products, winter hardiness, drought resistance, and resistance to
   pests. We have identified, preserved and now use in selection, as
   sources of good agronomic characters of resistance to low temperatures
   in winter, such varieties as Riesling of the Rhine, Rkatsiteli, Aligote,
   Riesling of Italy, Traminer Pink, Pinot Noir, Rara Neagra, Cabernet
   Sauvignon, Coarna Neagra, Pinot Gris, Gamay Freaux, Saperavi, Muscat
   Ottonel, Madeleine Angevine, Cabernet Franc, Khikhvi, Pearl of Csaba,
   Chardonnay, Krasnostop of Anapa, Dostoiniy, Krasnostop AZOS, etc.The
   collection has given birth to twenty seven varieties and elite forms, of
   which twelve varieties have been sent to the State Committee for the
   Testing of New Varieties of Agricultural Plants (Pluto, Muzhestvenniy
   (Courageous), Gordiy (Proud), Maran, Varvarovsky, Harmony, Progress,
   Gorniy (Mountaneous), Saturn, Dimitry, Vladimir, Kurchansky). We carry
   out a molecular genetic testing of the accumulated gene pool and
   DNA-classification of varieties. We have studied the microsatellite
   polymorphism in the genotypes of autochthonous grape varieties of the
   Don River and the Republic of Dagestan. We are performing the
   DNA-classification of varieties selected by the North Caucasian Regional
   Research Institute of Horticulture and Viticulture (Krasnodar), which is
   advantageous for the identification of pure varieties in planting
   material and vineyards and specifying of the parent forms of grape
   varieties, as well as when any disputes arise as to the variety

   zones, the origins and dynamic properties depend on region-wide
   conditions: in warm-temperate and subarid conditions, the processes of
   desertification are manifested with the leading role of the

Abstract = {Triticum aestivum L. (bread wheat) is the most important cereal crop in
   world grain production, including in the territory of the Russian
   Federation. One of the most important factors influencing the yield and
   quality of wheat grain is the affection of plants with leaf rust
   (Puccinia triticina Erikss.). To broaden the set of sources for
   effective rust resistance, spring bread wheat samples from N.I. Vavilov
   All-Russian Institute of Plant Genetic Resources (VIR) were monitored
   for adult resistance to the disease under natural infections for many
   decades at three distant locations of the Russian Federation: the
   Dagestan Experimental Station (DES) of VIR (10,549 accessions),
   Yekaterinino Experimental Station (YES) (4384 accessions), and Pushkin
   Experimental Field (PEF) (7704 accessions). Information on the disease
   development at these three stations is presented at least for 51 last
   years. As a result of disease development evaluation under natural
   epiphytotic conditions for not less than 3 years, 293 (15 landraces, 127
   breeding lines, and 151 commercial varieties), 118 (1 landrace, 38
   breeding lines, and 79 commercial varieties), and 127 (10 landraces, 48
   breeding lines, and 69 commercial varieties) samples were classified as
   resistant to leaf rust at DES, YES, and PEF, respectively. Among samples
   from the State Register of Breeding Achievements in Russia, 15, 13, and
   8 spring wheat varieties were resistant to leaf rust at DES, YES, and
   PEF, respectively. Juvenile resistance was estimated under laboratory
   conditions after seedling inoculation with a complex population of P.
   triticina: 73 highly resistant varieties and breeding lines were
   identified; all landraces, including those classified as resistant in
   the fields, were susceptible to disease at the seedling stage. A total
   of 26 wheat accessions were identified to be resistant to leaf rust at
   two to three locations; 14 of them possess adult resistance, and 12
   samples have seedling resistance. According to results of PCR
   amplification with primers specific to markers of effective genes for
   leaf rust resistance, 6 accessions have gene Lr9, 1 sample is protected
   by Lr19, and 1 sample possesses gene Lr24. Wheat samples identified as
   possessing effective seedling or adult resistance could be of interest
   for breeding in some regions of the Russian Federation and other
   countries.},

Abstract = {In the Russian Federation, according to the ``Procedure and conditions
   for appraisal of fine-wool breeds of sheep{''} approved by the Ministry
   of Agriculture on October 5, 2010, by order No. 335, fine-fleeced sheep,
   according to the type of animal and folding of the skin, are divided
   into three groups: animals with insufficient folding of the skin that
   evade the meat type (C-); animals with increased folding on the neck and
   trunk, deviating to a woolly type (C +). The purpose of this work was to
   determine the appropriateness of selecting newborn lambs of the Grozny
   breed by the type of skin folding. The research was carried out during
   the period from 2014 to 2017 in the Limited Liability Company
   ``Plemozvod ``Chervlenye Buruny{''} of the Republic of Dagestan. During
   the lambing period on day 1-3 after the birth, 480 single and double
   lambs of both sexes were selected, which were previously divided into
   three groups according to the type of skin folding. It was found that
   the thickness of the skin of multi-folded animals at the age of 18
   months was 3115.6 mu m, normal folded - 3056.8 mu m and non - folded -
   2864.1 mu m. The number of all hair follicles per 1 mm(2) of skin was
   82.9, 80.1 and 65.1 pieces respectively. The percentage of yield of pure
   wool was greatest in non - folded sheep (54.9 - 56.71\%) and the lowest
   - in multi-folded (51.64 - 55.96\%). The true length of the wool on the
   side at the age of 13 months in single ewes of the type ``C-{''} was
   14.50 cm, type ``C{''} -14.45 cm and type ``C +{''} - 12.24 cm. Animals
   of the type ``C-{''} stand in the first place in the strength of wool,
   this indicator in their topographic areas is equal to: side - 7,48, back
   - 6,18, belly - 5,1 and thigh - 6,91 km. Strength of wool of the type
   ``C{''} in the areas were, respectively, 6.64, 5.56.4.84 and 6.55 cN /
   tex, and of the type ``C +{''} - 6.12; 5.25; 4.48 and 5.76 cN / tex.},

Abstract = {This article is dedicated to analyzing epidemiological situation of
   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in the subjects of the North Caucasian
   Federal District (from 2005 to 2021) and developing a new approach to
   improve epidemiological forecasting by using an in-progress
   ``prognostic{''} model. The study is comprehensive, using
   epidemiological methods and mathematical statistics. The epidemiological
   analysis was carried out based on information from the databases on the
   incidence rate for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever presented as a
   project and maps of infectious disease focus epidemiological
   examination. The ``prognostic{''} morbidity model is developed based on
   Bayes' theorem and Wald's sequential statistical analysis. The factors
   information calculation was carried out by using the Kullback method.
   The value of climatic factors was retrieved from the database of the
   Center for Collective Use ``IKI-monitoring{''} of the Space Research
   Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The data obtained indicate
   that the majority of patients with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
   within the studied long-term period in the Stavropol Territory (629) and
   the Republic of Dagestan (46) were revealed. Isolated cases in the
   Kabardino-Balkarian Republic (2), the Karachay-Cherkess Republic (3) and
   the Republic of Ingushetia (2) were noted. Infection by the
   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever causative agent via the transmission
   mechanism occurred mainly during the care after farm animals in 59.4\%.
   The prevalence of moderate forms of CrimeanCongo hemorrhagic fever
   (79\%) was noted, with hemorrhagic manifestations (over the last five
   years) observed almost in half of the patients. The proportion of
   correct preliminary diagnoses during patient hospitalization was 49\%.
   While testing the ``prognostic{''} model in 2021 particularly in the
   Stavropol Territory, a complete exact coincidence for predicted and the
   actual data was obtained for 11 districts (42.3\%). False positive
   (38.5\%) and overestimated (11.5\%) data at this stage of the study do
   not significantly reduce the predictive value of the model, since they
   often reflect registered infection case that occurred at the patient's
   place of residence in another administrative region, underdiagnoses of
   mild forms of CrimeanCongo hemorrhagic fever in medical institutions or
   high efficiency of preventive measures against ticks measures carried
   out before the beginning of the epidemic season in individual municipal
   districts. False negative results were 7.7\%. Thus, the results of the
   analysis evidence about a need to improve the training of medical
   personnel for the timely detection of patients with Crimean-Congo
   hemorrhagic fever and to enhance the effectiveness of preventive
   measures against ticks. The results of testing the ``prognostic{''}
   model confirm the feasibility and hold promise to continue the study.},

Abstract = {Aim. The aim of the research was to identify the effect of types of
   fertilizer on increasing soil fertility and corn yield of grain and
   sorghum in conditions of irrigation of the Tersko-Sulak subprovince.
   Methods. Carrying out some field experiments: conducting observations
   and laboratory tests, selection of soil and plant samples was carried
   out according to generally accepted methods: statistical processing of
   yield data was carried out by the method of variance analysis based on
   Kirov Federal State Unitary Enterprise and FSBSI Dagestan Agricultural
   Research Institute named after F.G. Kisriev. Results. Studies showed
   that in the post-harvest period after harvesting winter wheat, it is
   better to cultivate green manure with the presence of legumes. A
   valuable biological feature of them is the ability to absorb atmospheric
   nitrogen. The powerful root system of the seeding pea improves the
   physical properties of the soil, as well as microbiological activity.
   The most favorable conditions are created for the growth and development
   of maize and sorghum, after plowing of fertilizers in the stubble period
   in the conditions of irrigation of the Tersko-Sulak subprovince, by
   applying mineral fertilizers at a dose of N-150 P-75 K-75, seeding peas,
   manure (30 t / ha), In these cases, on average, over two years, the
   highest yield of maize was 5.6-5.7-5.5 t / ha and grain sorghum,
   respectively, 4.7-4.8-4.5 t / ha. Conclusion. For the first time, in
   conditions of irrigation of the Tersko-Sulak subprovince, were obtained
   the results on the effectiveness of different types of fertilizers
   introduced into the soil.},

Abstract = {Analysis of the species composition and community structure of helminths
   in saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) was performed using multi-year
   (1979-2013) data collected from the ``Askania Nova{''} Biosphere
   Reserve, Ukraine. During this period, 31 saiga antelopes of different
   ages (7 calves, 24 adults) were examined; totally, more then 63,900
   helminth specimens were collected and identified by morphological
   criteria. Levels of saiga infection by nematodes were from 39 to 671 EPG
   (207 +/- 132 SD); seasonal fluctuations in saiga infections were
   insignificant (Mann-Whitney test; p>0.05). Nineteen helminth species
   were found in saigas in the ``Askania Nova{''}: 3 species of Cestoda
   (Avitellina centripunctata, Moniezia expansa and Taenia hydatigena) and
   16 species of Nematoda (Chabertia ovina, Haemonchus contortus,
   Marshallagia marshalli, Cooperia oncophora, Camelostrongylus mentulatus,
   Aonchotheca bovis, Skrjabinema ovis, Oesophagostomum venulosum,
   Trichostrongylus axei, T. colubriformis, T. probolorus, Ostertagia
   ostertagi, O. circumcincta, O. trifurcata, Nematodirus spp., Trichurus
   ovis). From 2 to 13 species per one host were observed. Nematodes
   dominated within the parasite community and composed more then 99 \% of
   the total helminths found. Significant differences were found in
   helminth diversity between young and adult saigas (p<0.05).
   Prevalence-frequency distribution revealed multimodal structure of
   helminth community with dominant, subdominant, background and rare
   species. The highest number of helminthes (14 species and 50 \% of the
   total amount) inhabited the small intestine; 11 species (45 \%) were
   found in the abomasum and 9 species (5 \%) in the large intestine. The
   Bray-Curtis cluster analysis revealed significant differences within the
   helminth communities in saigas from the ``Askania Nova{''} Biosphere
   Reserve and saigas from Kazakhstan, Dagestan and Kalmykia.},
