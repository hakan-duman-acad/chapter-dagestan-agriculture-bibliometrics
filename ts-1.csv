caucasian,HISTORICAL AND AREAL ASPECTS OF NATURAL RESOURCE TERMINOLOGY IN EAST CAUCASIAN LANGUAGES,10.1163/1573384X-20130305,WOS000323085400004,"THE PRESENT PAPER DISCUSSES THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF SELECTED TERMS IN THE WORLD OF EAST CAUCASIAN LANGUAGES THAT ARE RELATED TO THE DOMAIN OF METALLURGY (COPPER, IRON, TIN, PLUMB, GOLD, AND SILVER) AUGMENTED BY TERMS FOR `COAL' AND `SALT'. A CLOSER INSPECTION OF THESE TERMS SHOWS THAT NONE OF THEM CAN BE RECONSTRUCTED FOR PROTO-EAST CAUCASIAN. RATHER, WE HAVE TO DEAL EITHER WITH TERMS THAT HAVE BEEN COINED IN THE INTERMEDIATE PROTOLANGUAGES (NAKH, AVAR-ANDIAN, TSEZIAN, LEZGIAN, LAK, DARGWA, AND KHINALUG) OR WITH MORE OR LESS RECENT LOANS STEMMING MAINLY FROM THE IRANIAN AND TURKIC LANGUAGES. THE ABSENCE OF RECONSTRUCTABLE TERMS FOR THE ITEMS UNDER REVIEW SUGGESTS THAT THE SPEAKERS OF THE EAST CAUCASIAN PROTO-LANGUAGE HAD NOT BEEN INVOLVED EXPRESSIVELY IN METALLURGIC TRADITIONS (AS OPPOSED TO FARMING TRADITIONS). TENTATIVELY, THESE SPEAKERS CAN THUS BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE EARLY FARMING CULTURE WITHIN THE COMPLEX OF THE KURO-ARAXES CULTURE. ONLY AFTER THE PROTO-LANGUAGE DISINTEGRATED DUE TO THE MIGRATION OF MOST OF ITS SPEAKERS IN THE DAGESTAN AND THE REGIONS OF CHECHNYA, SOME SOCIETIES RELATED TO THESE INTERMEDIATE PROTO-LANGUAGES MUST HAVE BEEN INVOLVED MORE EXPRESSIVELY IN METALLURGIC TRADITIONS. THE MORE RECENT LOANS, E.G. FOR COPPER, GOLD, AND SILVER, STEMMING FROM IRANIAN (PERSIAN) AND TURKIC (KUMYK AND AZERI) ILLUSTRATE A SHIFT IN CONCEPTUALISING THESE OBJECTS: THEY WERE NOW INTERPRETED AS ARTIFACTS (RATHER THAN AS NATURAL RESOURCES) THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CULTURES OF THE DOMINANT `ORIENTAL' SOCIETIES. THE PAPER CAN BE SEEN AS A PRELIMINARY STUDY CONCERNING THE AREAL DISTRIBUTION OF LEXICAL PATTERNS IN THE EASTERN CAUCASUS FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE."
caucasian,SOME PECULIARITIES OF SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION AND POPULATION-DENSITY OF EAST CAUCASIAN TUR (CAPRA-CYLINDRICORNIS),NA,WOSA1994PR64900011,"THE ECOLOGY OF THE SPECIES WAS STUDIED IN DAGHESTAN THROUGHOUT ALL THE SEASONS FROM 1986 TO 1993. TWO MAIN FACTORS DETERMINE THE NUMBER AND DISTRIBUTION OF TURS: 1) INACCESSIBILITY OF HABITATS (ROCKY AND STEEP MOUNTAIN SLOPES), THE AREA OF MAIN RANGES: 2) FEEDING CONDITIONS AND FIRST OF ALL THE AREA AND PRODUCTIVITY OF WINTER PASTURES. THE HIGHEST POPULATION DENSITY OF TURS WAS OBSERVED ON THE SPURS OF LARGE MOUNTAIN-MASSES, WHICH ARE MORE THAN 7-10 KM LONG AND MORE THAN 4000 M HIGH. THE POPULATION DENSITY OF TURS VARIES IN DIFFERENT REGIONS FROM 1,8 TO 7,3 ANIMALS PER 100 HA., THEIR TOTAL NUMBER IS ABOUT 20 000 ANIMALS WHICH IS MORE THAN 2-2,5 TIMES AS HIGH AS NOTED IN FORMER PAPERS CONCERNING THIS SPECIES. THE STUDY REVEALED, THAT IN THE AREAS, WHICH ARE NOT INTENSIVELY USED FOR AGRICULTURE, THE AVERAGE WINTER DENSITY OF THE POPULATIONS IN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES OF THE AREA IS STABLE (31 TO 35 ANIMALS PER 100 HA.). PROBABLY, IT IS DETERMINED BY CARRYING CAPACITY OF WINTER PASTURES AND REFLECTS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF A POPULATION. IN AREAS, WHERE THE DEGREE OF EXPLOITATION OF WINTER PASTURES BY CATTLE EXCEED 80\%, THE POPULATION DENSITY OF TURS REDUCES AND DOES NOT EXCEED 11.5 TO 15.3 ANIMALS PER 100 HA. THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE CONSUMPTION OF SOME PART OF VEGETATION BY SHEEP."

IS ARTICLE IS ONE OF THE FIRST ATTEMPTS TO CONDUCT SUCH RESEARCH IN DAGHESTAN. IN THIS REPUBLIC WAQF FOUNDATIONS WERE LEGALLY ACKNOWLEDGED UNTIL 23 JANUARY 1927, WHEN A DECREE TURNED THEM INTO NATIONAL STATE PROPERTY THAT WOULD BE DIVIDED AMONG THEIR PREVIOUS HOLDERS IN COOPERATIVES AND KOLKHOZES. IS IT POSSIBLE TO RECOVER THE EARLY SOVIET HISTORY OF WAQF IN THE PERIOD 1920-1927, WHEN IT FUNCTIONED UNDER THE PROTECTION OF STATE LAW, WHILE REMAINING ALMOST COMPLETELY EXEMPT FROM STATE CONTROL AND REGISTRATION? WHAT CAN BE SAID ON COMPETING VISIONS OF WAQF AND ITS PLACE IN THE SOVIET DISCOURSE OF MOUNTAINEERS' SURVIVAL AND MODERNITY? WHAT ROLE DID IT PLAY IN THE COUNTRYSIDE ON THE EVE OF COLLECTIVIZATION? TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS THE AUTHOR FOCUSES ON VILLAGE COMMUNITIES WHICH, AS HE ARGUES, CONSTITUTED CRUCIAL LEVEL OF POST-REVOLUTIONARY ISLAMIC ENDOWMENTS.. IS RESEARCH INTRODUCES A UNIQUE WAQF REGISTER OF THE 1920S FROM THE VILLAGE OF DIBGASHI. IT RELIES ON A BROAD RANGE OF MUSLIM AND SOVIET SOURCES IN THE ARABIC, CAUCASIAN AND RUSSIAN LANGUAGES, INCLUDING ORAL HISTORIES GATHERED BY THE AUTHOR AMONG CONTEMPORARY VILLAGERS IN MOUNTAIN DAGHESTAN."

THESE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE A MANY-SIDED TRAIT. THERE WERE MILITARY CONFLICTS CONNECTED WITH THE CLAIMS OF KHUMYK FEUDAL OWNERS TO THE NEIGHBORING SIDES, WITH THEIR WISH TO APPLY THEIR INFLUENCE TO THE VILLAGE COMMUNITY, AND GOOD RELATIONSHIPS OF THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION IN THE AFOREMENTIONED COMMUNITIES THAT WERE REFLECTED IN SPIRITUAL AND MATERIAL CULTURES, AS WELL AS IN GOOD ECONOMIC RELATIONS."

THE SAMPLE SIZE WAS 139.115 IN THE SOVIET REGION AND 101.278 IN THE KHASAVURT REGION, THE SAMPLES INCLUDED 344 AND 338 PATIENTS WITH EPILEPSY, RESPECTIVELY. THE AGE- AND SEX - STANDARDIZED PREVALENCE OF EPILEPSY WAS 2.06 (CI95\% 1.80-2.32) CASES PER 1000 POPULATION IN THE SOVIET REGION AND 2.98 (CI95\% 2.60-3.35) CASES PER 1000 POPULATION IN THE KHASAVURT REGION (P=0.05). THE PREVALENCE OF EPILEPSY WAS HIGHER IN MEN. FOCAL (LOCATION-RELATED) FORMS OF EPILEPSY WERE MOST FREQUENT, WITH THE HIGHEST FREQUENCY OF PARTIAL SEIZURES WITH SECONDARY GENERALIZATION. CRANIAL-BRAIN INJURY, INTRA- AND PERINATAL PATHOLOGY AND CEREBRAL VASCULAR DISEASES WERE THE MAIN CAUSES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF FOCAL EPILEPSIES. SEIZURE FREQUENCY GREATER THAN 12 PER YEAR WAS NOTED IN MORE THAN A HALF OF PATIENTS. THE STUDY OF SOCIAL ASPECTS SHOWED THAT ONLY SMALL PORTION OF PATIENTS WORKED, MOST OF PATIENTS RECEIVED DISABILITY PENSIONS. DIFFERENCES IN THE EDUCATION LEVEL WERE IDENTIFIED AS WELL."

I. E. HYPERTHERMIA, CHEMICAL IRRITANTS, HIGH INSOLATION, OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. A HIGH INCIDENCE OF SKIN PRECANCER AND CANCER (0.3 AND 1.3\%, RESPECTIVELY) WAS DETECTED AMONG THE HIGHLANDERS EXPOSED TO HIGH INSOLATION. BASAL-CELL CARCINOMA IN THESE AREAS IS 3-4 TIMES MORE INCIDENT THAT SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA. PRECANCER DERMATOSES AND SKIN CANCER INVOLVE OPEN SKIN SITES IN 45-80\% OF CASES. UNTIMELY VISITS TO DOCTORS RESULT IN DEVELOPMENT OF GRAVE FORMS OF SKIN CANCER. EARLY ACTIVE DETECTION OF SKIN PRECANCER AND CANCER IS THE KEY POINT IN TIMELY DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, AND PREVENTION OF THIS CONDITION, PARTICULARLY OF ITS GRAVE FORMS."
dagestan,THE DUAL ORIGIN OF TATI-SPEAKERS FROM DAGESTAN AS WRITTEN IN THE GENEALOGY OF UNIPARENTAL VARIANTS,10.1002/ajhb.22220,WOS000304986300001,"OBJECTIVES: TAT LANGUAGE IS CLASSIFIED IN AN IRANIAN SUBBRANCH OF THE INDO-EUROPEAN FAMILY. IT IS SPOKEN IN THE CAUCASUS AND IN THE WEST CASPIAN REGION BY POPULATIONS WITH HETEROGENEOUS CULTURAL TRADITIONS AND RELIGION WHOSE ANCESTRY IS UNKNOWN. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO GET A FIRST INSIGHT ABOUT THE GENETIC HISTORY OF THIS PECULIAR LINGUISTIC GROUP. METHODS: WE INVESTIGATED THE UNIPARENTAL GENE POOLS, DEFINED BY NRY AND MTDNA HIGH-RESOLUTION MARKERS, IN TWO TATI-SPEAKING COMMUNITIES FROM DAGESTAN: MOUNTAIN JEWS OR JUHUR, WHO SPEAK THE JUDEO-TAT DIALECT, AND THE TATS, WHO SPEAK THE MUSLIM-TAT DIALECT. THE SAMPLES HAVE BEEN COLLECTED IN MONOETHNIC RURAL VILLAGES AND SELECTED ON THE BASIS OF GENEALOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS. A NOVEL APPROACH AIMED AT RESOLVING CRYPTIC CASES IN THE RECENT HISTORY OF HUMAN POPULATIONS, WHICH COMBINES THE PROPERTIES OF UNIPARENTAL GENETIC MARKERS WITH THE POTENTIAL OF FORWARD-IN-TIME COMPUTER SIMULATIONS, IS PRESENTED. RESULTS: JUDEO-TATS EMERGED AS A GROUP WITH TIGHT MATRILINEAL GENETIC LEGACY WHO SEPARATED EARLY FROM OTHER JEWISH COMMUNITIES. TATS EXHIBITED GENETIC SIGNALS OF A MUCH LONGER IN SITU EVOLUTION, WHICH APPEAR AS SUBSTANTIALLY UNLINKED WITH OTHER INDO-IRANIAN ENCLAVES IN THE CAUCASUS. CONCLUSIONS: THE INDEPENDENT DEMOGRAPHIC HISTORIES OF THE TWO SAMPLES, WITH MUTUALLY REVERSED PROFILES AT PATERNALLY AND MATERNALLY TRANSMITTED GENETIC SYSTEMS, SUGGEST THAT GEOGRAPHIC PROXIMITY AND LINGUISTIC ASSIMILATION OF TATI-SPEAKERS FROM DAGESTAN DO NOT REFLECT A COMMON ANCESTRY.

THE DATA DEMONSTRATE THAT THE STRENGTH OF ISLAM AS BOTH A RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL INSTITUTION VARIED REGIONALLY DESPITE THE SHARED EXPERIENCE OF SOVIET ANTI-RELIGIOUS POLICIES. MUSLIMS IN CHECHNYA AND DAGESTAN WERE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO REPORT THAT THEY ACTIVELY PRACTICED ISLAM THAN MUSLIMS LIVING IN KABARDINO-BALKARIYA, TATARSTAN, AND BASHKORTOSTAN. MOROEVER, RELIGIOUS PRACTICE WAS HIGH AMONG NON-TRADITIONAL GROUPS OF CHECHENTSY AND AVARTSY. THE YOUNG, THE URBAN MIGRANTS, THE HIGHLY EDUCATED, AND MEN REPORTED HIGH LEVELS OF ACTIVE WORSHIP. IN BASHKORTOSTAN, TATARSTAN, AND KABARDINO-BALKARIYA, IN CONTRAST, ACTIVE RELIGIOSITY WAS PRIMARILY CONFINED TO OLD, RURAL WOMEN WITH LOW LEVELS OF EDUCATION. THESE DIFFERENCES, IT IS ARGUED, ARE LINKED TO THE SUFI ISLAM TRADITION PRESENT IN CHECHNYA AND DAGESTAN BUT ABSENT IN THE OTHER MUSLIM AUTONOMOUS REPUBLICS."

NA,THE ROLE OF MINERAL FERTILIZER IN INCREASING THE PRODUCTIVITY AND QUALITY OF WINTER WHEAT GRAIN,NA,WOS000410728200165,"WHEAT IS A LEADING POACEAE GRAIN CROP OF THE SOUTH OF RUSSIA. THE VALUE OF WHEAT IS THAT IT CONTAINS GLUTEN, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR BREAD AND BAKERY PRODUCTS, PASTA, BUT ITS YIELD REMAINS AT THE LEVEL OF 2.5-3.0 T/HA, ALTHOUGH ITS POTENTIAL IS MUCH HIGHER. ONE OF THE REASONS LIES IN THE INEFFICIENT USE OF RECOMMENDATIONS ON ENERGY-SAVING TECHNOLOGIES WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF CALCULATED NORMS OF FERTILIZERS AND INCREASED REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SELECTION OF RECOMMENDED OR REGIONALIZED COMPLEX-RESISTANT CROP VARIETIES WITH HIGH POTENTIAL PRODUCTIVITY, PRODUCT QUALITY, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND EFFICIENCY TO USE SOIL AND CLIMATIC RESOURCES IN THE REGION. HIGH-QUALITY GRAIN PRODUCTION IS THE BASIS OF AGRICULTURAL POLICY OF OUR COUNTRY. THE LEVEL OF GRAIN PRODUCTION CURRENTLY DOES NOT MEET THE COUNTRY'S NEEDS IN PROVIDING WITH HIGH-QUALITY ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY FOOD GRAIN. OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THE STRUCTURE OF AREAS UNDER WHEAT ARE REDUCED FROM YEAR TO YEAR. IN THIS REGARD, THE INCREASE IN THE GROSS GRAIN HARVEST IS POSSIBLE BY INCREASING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF CROPS. MODERN SCIENCE AND BEST PRACTICES IN THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SHOW THAT THE RATIONAL USE OF LAND, THE USE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IMPROVE SOIL FERTILITY AND PRODUCTIVITY OF CROPS, RESPECTIVELY [1,2]. IMPROVEMENT OF THE HIGHLY EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGICAL METHODS FOR FLAT LANDS OF DAGESTAN WHICH CAN ENSURE THE PRESERVATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF SOIL FERTILITY AND ON THIS BASIS THE PRODUCT QUALITY WHILE REDUCING ENERGY AND ECONOMIC COST IS AN ACTUAL PROBLEM OF MODERN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. WINTER WHEAT OCCUPIES A LEADING POSITION IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR OF THE REPUBLIC OF DAGESTAN, SO INCREASING ITS YIELD AND PRODUCTION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY PRODUCTS, BASED ON THE RATIONAL USE OF MINERAL FERTILIZERS IS CLOSELY LINKED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF FERTILIZER SYSTEMS. THE INTRODUCTION OF CALCULATED DOSES OF MINERAL FERTILIZERS INTO THE SOIL BALANCES THE PRODUCTIVITY OF WINTER WHEAT AT A HIGH LEVEL. LAND RESOURCES OF DAGESTAN DIVERSE IN AGRO-CLIMATIC AND SOIL RESOURCES, WHICH AFFECTS THE PRODUCTIVITY OF WINTER WHEAT. THE NEED FOR A PRECISE DEFINITION OF THE OF MINERAL NUTRITION NORMS FOR WINTER WHEAT IN THE CONDITIONS OF THE FLAT ZONE OF DAGESTAN DETERMINES ITS RELEVANCE AND NATIONAL ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE. BASED ON THE ABOVE-MENTIONED, THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS IN THE PRODUCTION OF GRAIN IS HIGH YIELDS OF HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS WHILE ENSURING THE OIL FERTILITY, AND EXCLUDING THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. COMPENSATE THE REMOVAL OF NUTRIENTS IS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF MINERAL FERTILIZERS, AND THE LATTER IS REFLECTED ON THE QUALITY OF THE GRAIN. IN OUR PAPER, WE PRESENT THE RESULTS OF RESEARCH ON THE EFFECT OF MINERAL FERTILIZERS ON THE YIELD AND QUALITY OF WINTER WHEAT. IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE STUDIED THE EFFECT OF MINERAL FERTILIZERS RATES ON THE DYNAMICS OF THE PROTEIN CONTENT, WET GLUTEN AND NITRATES IN THE WINTER WHEAT GRAIN [8,11,12]."

DATA COLLECTED AMONG THE RUTUL, A SMALL GROUP DWELLING IN THE MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHERN DAGESTAN, SHED LIGHT ON THE MEANING OF MUSLIM RELIGIOSITY AT THE MICROSOCIAL LEVEL OF A KOLKHOZ OR RURAL CLAN. FOCUS IS PLACED: ON THE TYPES OF SHRINES IN THE SAMUR VALLEY, THEIR ARCHITECTURE AND RITES; ON LEGENDS ABOUT THE SHEIKHS BURIED THERE; AND ON THE SOCIAL FUNCTIONS OF THESE SHRINES AND THEIR RELATION TO SUFISM. MUSLIM PRACTICES AMONG THE RUTUL DURING THE POST-SOVIET ERA ARE HYBRID. THEY ARE NOT REMNANTS FROM A PRE-ISLAMIC PAST; NOR ARE THEY RELATED TO THE RITES OF SUFI BROTHERHOODS. THEY ARE EVIDENCE OF THE OVERALL TRANSFORMATION OF LOCAL MUSLIM SOCIETY DUE TO MODERN SECULAR REFORMS. TO BETTER DELIMIT THE POST-SOVIET PATCHWORK OF RELIGIONS, WE MUST ABANDON ONCE AND FOR ALL SIMPLISTIC CONTRASTS BETWEEN TRADITIONAL AND MODERN ISLAM, BETWEEN AN ISLAM OF THE BOOK AND POPULAR ISLAM."
