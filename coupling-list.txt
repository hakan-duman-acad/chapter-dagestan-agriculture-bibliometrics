ABSTRACT:
Local grape cultivars from different countries of the world are an important part of the gene pool of this culture. Of particular interest are the genotypes of the most ancient regions of viticulture. The territories of the subtropical zone of georgia and the central part of abkhazia belong to one of the centers of origin of the cultural grapevine. The purpose of the work was to genotype native abkhazian grape cultivars, to study their genetic diversity based on dna profiling data and to compare them with the genotypes of local varieties of other viticultural regions. Samples of plants were taken on the territory of the republic of abkhazia in private farmsteads and in the collection of the agricultural firm ``vina i vody abkhazii'' (''wines and waters of abkhazia'').The genotyping of the abkhazian cultivars avasirhva, agbizh, azhapsh, azhizhkvakva, azhikvaca, atvizh, atyrkuazh, achkykazh, kachich was carried out using 14 dna markers, 9 of which are standard microsatellite markers recommended for the identification of grape varieties. To improve our knowledge about the sizes of the identified alleles, we used the dna of grape cultivars with a known allelic composition at the analyzed loci. Statistical analysis of the data showed that the observed heterozygosity for the analyzed loci exceeded expected values, which indicates a genetic polymorphism of the studied sample of varieties. Evaluation of genetic similarity within the analyzed group based on the results of genotyping at 14 loci showed that the cultivars kachich and azhapsh differed from the other abkhazian varieties. The obtained dna profiles of the abkhazian cultivars were checked for compliance with dna-fingerprints of grape varieties in the vitis international variety catalogue. The georgian varieties azhizhkvakva and tsitska turned out to be synonyms according to dna profiles, two varieties from the database (italian albana bianca and georgian ojaleshi) have differences in dna fingerprints from the varieties atyrkuazh and azhikvatsa only in one allele, respectively. When comparing the identified abkhazian grape genotypes, their difference from the sample of dagestan, don, greek, turkish, italian, spanish, and french varieties and genetic similarity with the genotypes of georgian grapes were shown.

ABSTRACT:
On the basis of the allelic composition of ten microsatellite loci and mtdna sequences, we studied the genetic structure of the common hamster populations that inhabit cities and suburban settlements in ciscaucasia. It was shown that, in urbanized territories, the hamster population is divided into separated groups, the genetic differences between which are high and not related to the distance between them. On the outskirts of cities adjacent to undeveloped or green areas and further in rural areas, the degree of isolation of neighboring hamster settlements decreases, and the level of genetic differences between them begins to correspond to the distance separating the settlements. In the course of work, this species was first registered within the territory of the easternmost part of ciscaucasia, in the republic of dagestan.

ABSTRACT:
The dagestan mountain (dm) cattle breed was established to provide cheese and milk products to mountain dwellers in the specific conditions of the republic of dagestan in southern russia. Only 650 head of dm cattle were registered in 2020, and their ``breed purity'' is questionable. We aimed to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of modern dm cattle using short tandem repeat (str) markers. The sample included 150 animals collected from private owners in dagestan during a scientific expedition (n = 32) and provided by a gene pool farm (n = 118). An additional 166 samples from other cattle breeds distributed in the breeding zone of dm cattle were used as the comparison groups. The genotypes for the 11 str loci recommended by isag were obtained using a genetic analyzer. We identified a high level of genetic diversity as revealed by allelic richness calculations (ar = 6.82 vs. 4.38-5.82 in other cattle breeds) and observed heterozygosity indices (uhe = 0.76 vs. 0.65-0.72). Based on the structure results, animals with low levels of admixture with other breeds were found within the dm cattle, which can be considered as candidates for use in germplasm conservation programs.

ABSTRACT:
Objectives: tat language is classified in an iranian subbranch of the indo-european family. It is spoken in the caucasus and in the west caspian region by populations with heterogeneous cultural traditions and religion whose ancestry is unknown. The aim of this study is to get a first insight about the genetic history of this peculiar linguistic group. Methods: we investigated the uniparental gene pools, defined by nry and mtdna high-resolution markers, in two tati-speaking communities from dagestan: mountain jews or juhur, who speak the judeo-tat dialect, and the tats, who speak the muslim-tat dialect. The samples have been collected in monoethnic rural villages and selected on the basis of genealogical relationships. A novel approach aimed at resolving cryptic cases in the recent history of human populations, which combines the properties of uniparental genetic markers with the potential of forward-in-time computer simulations, is presented. Results: judeo-tats emerged as a group with tight matrilineal genetic legacy who separated early from other jewish communities. Tats exhibited genetic signals of a much longer in situ evolution, which appear as substantially unlinked with other indo-iranian enclaves in the caucasus. Conclusions: the independent demographic histories of the two samples, with mutually reversed profiles at paternally and maternally transmitted genetic systems, suggest that geographic proximity and linguistic assimilation of tati-speakers from dagestan do not reflect a common ancestry.

ABSTRACT:
Nowadays there is much tension in the russian modern vine growing industry around the issue of enhancing the range of grape varieties, which is aimed at production of highly adaptive grape plants and sustainable production of competitive grape varieties in the unstable stressing weather conditions of the moderate continental climate in the south of russia. In this view, we believe it important to carry out research into the origin, generation and preservation of genetic resources so that they can be involved in the selection process and reach most important objectives of the national economy. The role of a variety and ampelographic collections becomes more important. The anapa ampelographic collection (http://azosviv.info/category/ osnovnye\_razdely/anapskaya\_ampelograficheskaya\_kollekciya) is russia's largest gene pool depository of grape varieties brought from various countries of europe, asia and america, and russia's regions as well. It contains 4921 grape varieties, including vitis vinifera l. (2975), v. Amurensis rupr. (40), v. Labrusca l. (50), the interspecies varieties v. Vinifera l. X v. Amurensis rupr. (210), v. Vinifera l. X v. Labrusca l. (168), blended interspecies hybrids v. Vinifera lx hybrids sv (220), v. Vinifera l. X v. Amurensis rupr. X hybrids sv (70), and other samples. We carry out extensive research into collection varieties for their production and selection. We select varieties and forms showing good agronomic characters in productivity, quality of grapes and wine products, winter hardiness, drought resistance, and resistance to pests. We have identified, preserved and now use in selection, as sources of good agronomic characters of resistance to low temperatures in winter, such varieties as riesling of the rhine, rkatsiteli, aligote, riesling of italy, traminer pink, pinot noir, rara neagra, cabernet sauvignon, coarna neagra, pinot gris, gamay freaux, saperavi, muscat ottonel, madeleine angevine, cabernet franc, khikhvi, pearl of csaba, chardonnay, krasnostop of anapa, dostoiniy, krasnostop azos, etc.the collection has given birth to twenty seven varieties and elite forms, of which twelve varieties have been sent to the state committee for the testing of new varieties of agricultural plants (pluto, muzhestvenniy (courageous), gordiy (proud), maran, varvarovsky, harmony, progress, gorniy (mountaneous), saturn, dimitry, vladimir, kurchansky). We carry out a molecular genetic testing of the accumulated gene pool and dna-classification of varieties. We have studied the microsatellite polymorphism in the genotypes of autochthonous grape varieties of the don river and the republic of dagestan. We are performing the dna-classification of varieties selected by the north caucasian regional research institute of horticulture and viticulture (krasnodar), which is advantageous for the identification of pure varieties in planting material and vineyards and specifying of the parent forms of grape varieties, as well as when any disputes arise as to the variety authorship.

ABSTRACT:
Analysis of the species composition and community structure of helminths in saiga antelope (saiga tatarica) was performed using multi-year (1979-2013) data collected from the ``askania nova'' biosphere reserve, ukraine. During this period, 31 saiga antelopes of different ages (7 calves, 24 adults) were examined; totally, more then 63,900 helminth specimens were collected and identified by morphological criteria. Levels of saiga infection by nematodes were from 39 to 671 epg (207 +/- 132 sd); seasonal fluctuations in saiga infections were insignificant (mann-whitney test; p>0.05). Nineteen helminth species were found in saigas in the ``askania nova'': 3 species of cestoda (avitellina centripunctata, moniezia expansa and taenia hydatigena) and 16 species of nematoda (chabertia ovina, haemonchus contortus, marshallagia marshalli, cooperia oncophora, camelostrongylus mentulatus, aonchotheca bovis, skrjabinema ovis, oesophagostomum venulosum, trichostrongylus axei, t. Colubriformis, t. Probolorus, ostertagia ostertagi, o. Circumcincta, o. Trifurcata, nematodirus spp., trichurus ovis). From 2 to 13 species per one host were observed. Nematodes dominated within the parasite community and composed more then 99 \% of the total helminths found. Significant differences were found in helminth diversity between young and adult saigas (p<0.05). Prevalence-frequency distribution revealed multimodal structure of helminth community with dominant, subdominant, background and rare species. The highest number of helminthes (14 species and 50 \% of the total amount) inhabited the small intestine; 11 species (45 \%) were found in the abomasum and 9 species (5 \%) in the large intestine. The bray-curtis cluster analysis revealed significant differences within the helminth communities in saigas from the ``askania nova'' biosphere reserve and saigas from kazakhstan, dagestan and kalmykia.

ABSTRACT:
This paper studies ethnic differences in the fertility of the descendants of migrants in a highly polyethnic region of russia, dagestan (north caucasus). That region gives a rather rare example of an urban population whose majority is formed by migrants and their second - and third-generation descendants of several ethnicities which differ in fertility in their rural places of origin. We take the opportunity to consider the key hypotheses on the fertility of the descendants of migrants in this rather non-standard setting. The central question we address is whether the ethnic differences in fertility observed among rural residents are also passed on to descendants of rural-to-urban migrants. Another question concerns the role of education in preserving vs. Weakening ethnic differences in fertility between descendants of migrants. We analyze the russian population census 2010 data on the region under study, running poisson models for the total number of children and logistic models for progressions to different parities. Our main conclusion is that ethnic differences in fertility remain significant among descendants of rural-to-urban migrants. Arguably, this supports the socialization hypothesis, because contacts between co-ethnics are intensive in the region and interethnic marriages are rather infrequent, which helps young urban people to adopt patterns of reproductive behavior typical for their ethnicity. Among highly educated women, however, the ethnic differences in fertility are weaker, which might be related to the ease in the departure of such women from fertility trajectories of their co-ethnics.

ABSTRACT:
This article considers public opinion in the republic of dagestan on the expansion of hydrocarbon production in the russian sector of the caspian sea. The article reports the findings of a survey (n = 956) conducted in 2010 in fourteen rural locations in the republic. Overall, respondents uniformly oppose the proposed expansion of offshore oil and gas production in the russian sector of the caspian sea, seeing little economic benefit from this development and expressing concern about the environmental consequences. These findings resonate with work in geography on resource peripheries and development alternatives available in these locations.

ABSTRACT:
Two geographers report on the current challenges facing the inhabitants of the caucasus mountains on the borders of russia and its southern neighbors, georgia and azerbaijan. The authors discuss the impacts of new post-soviet borders and controls as well as unresolved conflicts in nagorno-karabakh, chechnya, south ossetia, abkhazia, and the prigorodnyy district of north ossetia, which have disrupted traditional ways of life and forced the peoples of the mountains to migrate or adjust their economic activities. Based on extensive field work in 2005-2006, and in the 1990s, they detect some signs of improvement in the new privatized environment after the difficult years of transition. However, the weak infrastructure of the region, combined with the high costs associated with development and modernization of peripheral locations, suggest that resettlement from the high mountains to the cities on the plains and piedmont is likely to continue.

ABSTRACT:
Studies of multilingual systems found in indigenous small-scale communities often assume that exogamous marriages are the norm in such societies and contribute to their linguistic diversity. This paper is an account of the language ideology of endogamous societies in rural highland daghestan (northeast caucasus). By studying language policing and language choice in infrequent mixed marriages, the paper uncovers the beliefs that support endogamy and reveals issues of linguistic identity and attitudes toward the usage of the matrilect within the family and the village. Interviews show that in-married women do not bring new languages to the villages, because they quickly acquire the local language new to them and use it with all their in-laws and their children. A strong association between villages and languages together with the ideology supporting linguistic homogeneity within the village contributes to the maintenance of the regional linguistic diversity.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. The unique gene pool of indigenous breeds in the dagestan caucasus is threatened by the increasingly widespread use of commercial breeds, which in turn risks narrowing the genetic base necessary to increase and maintain existing genetic diversity. For this reason, our research aimed to study the polymorphism of the prl, pit-1, gh genes in red steppe and caucasian brown cattle raised in the conditions of dagestan. Methods. Genotyping of red steppe and caucasian brown cattle was carried out using pcr-rflp methods. Using these methods, genetic analysis was carried out and polymorphism of the prolactin, somatotropin and pituitary-specific transcription factor genes was studied. Results. As a result of the genotyping of an experimental group of red steppe cattle, it was found that the distribution of two alleles and three genotypes (pit-1a and pit-1b; pit-1aa, pit-1bb, pit-1ab) of the pit-1 gene has a specific character. The specificity of the allelic spectrum of the prl gene is expressed in the high (0.84) frequency of occurrence of the prla allele and low (0.16) frequency of the prlb allele. This is reflected in the presence of homo- and heterozygous genotypes with a frequency of occurrence of 73.0; 23.0; 4.0 \%, respectively. Conclusion. Applied genetic approaches to improve the productive and breed qualities of livestock, which are modern and based on a more complete analysis of the genetic diversity and genotype of the studied populations, contribute to the conservation of zoned breeds. At the same time, intrapopulation variability and good adaptability should ensure the sustainable development of dairy cattle breeding in various climatic zones.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. Assessment of the incidence of leukemia virus in cattle using pcr diagnostics in herds of the republic of dagestan and study of the molecular genetic characteristics of circulating viruses. Materials and methods. 150 cattle blood samples were examined. Pcr diagnostics of samples for the presence of bovine leukosis virus (blv) were carried out using the realbest-vet dna blv test system and a laboratory set of primers. Some of the samples were sequenced using the sanger method and their phylogenetic analysis was performed. Results. Out of 150 samples, 24 samples were positive for the presence of blv. In the untsukulskiy district, no blv dna was detected in any of the 16 samples. In the karabudakhkentskiy district out of 40 - in 2 (5 \%), in buynakskiy district - in 1 out of 30 (3.3 \%) and in babayurtovskiy districtin 21 out of 60 samples blv was detected (35 \%). For 13 blv-positive samples, fragments of the env gene measuring 1000 bp were obtained and deciphered. According to phylogenetic analysis, 7 samples of blv belong to the 7th, and 6 - to the 4th genotype of blv. The blv genotype 4 isolated in the babayurtovskiy district clusters with viruses from kazakhstan, while viruses of genotype 4 from other farms cluster with russian blv. The studied samples of genotype 4 did not form common clusters. For the blv genotype 7 isolated in farms of the babayurtovskiy district, on the contrary, a combination of sequences into one cluster of genetically similar viruses was observed. Conclusion. Significant differences in the incidence of leukemia virus in livestock on farms in dagestan were revealed. No patterns were found in the registration of cattle cases with a specific breed of cattle or with the age of the animal. It has been shown that viruses of both genotypes 7 and 4 circulate in the republic. For blv 4, it is assumed that there are different ways of its introduction into farms but no associated chains of virus spread have been found. For blv genotype 7, transmission of blv has been registered, which indicates the need to strengthen leukemia prevention measures on farms.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. To study the polymorphism of the genes calpastatin (cast), somatotropin (gh) and differential growth factor (gdf9) of sheep of the dagestan mountain breed. Material and methods. Studies on the genetic typing of dagestan mountain sheep according to cast, gh and gdf9 genes were carried out in conditions of distant pasture farming in the republic of dagestan by the genetics and breeding laboratory of the federal agrarian scientific centre of the republic of dagestan, an accredited laboratory of immunogenetics and dna technologies of the all-russian research institute of sheep and goat breeding and a branch of the north caucasus federal scientific agrarian centre. These investigations were undertaken by the pcr-rflp method (polymyrase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism) on a tersik four-channel programmable thermal cycler from dna-technologia (russia) using specific primers synthesized in the synthol research and production laboratory (moscow). Results. Carrying out pcr-rflp revealed breed-specific alleles with different frequency of occurrence, which was: in the locus of the cast gene - allele cast(n) - 0.03; allele cast(m) - 0.97; at the gh gene locus - gh(a) allele - 100.0, gh(b) allele - 0; in the locus of the gdf9 gene - the gdf9(a) allele - 0.25, the gdf9(g) allele - 0.75, which determined the frequency of occurrence of the homo- and heterozygous genotypes: cast(nn), cast(mm) and cast(nm) - 93.0; 0 and 7.0\%; gh(aa), gh(bb) and gh(ab) - 100.0 and 0\%; gdf9(aa), gdf9(gg) and gof9(ag) - 16.0, 66.0 and 19.0a, respectively. Conclusion. The regularity revealed can be considered as an ecological factor that optimizes the adaptive functions of the sheep's organism, on the one hand, an evolutionary selection process that contributes to the creation of a specific way of genetic structures in the population, on the other. The assumption is made that the information obtained can serve as the beginning of a more in-depth study of the unique gene pool of sheep of the dagestan rock breed for its further improvement. Variants of genetic marker profiles of parental pairs are proposed for accumulation in breeding herds bred in different ecological-geographical zones and genotypes of carriers of selection-significant genetic structures.

ABSTRACT:
In islam, saint worship (awliya) is a problem for both the muslim scholars (ulema) and academics specialized in mid-eastern studies. Its characteristics during the post-soviet era are identified in the attempt to review modern approaches to studying the late 20th-century islamic revival in the northern caucasus. Data collected among the rutul, a small group dwelling in the mountains of southern dagestan, shed light on the meaning of muslim religiosity at the microsocial level of a kolkhoz or rural clan. Focus is placed: on the types of shrines in the samur valley, their architecture and rites; on legends about the sheikhs buried there; and on the social functions of these shrines and their relation to sufism. Muslim practices among the rutul during the post-soviet era are hybrid. They are not remnants from a pre-islamic past; nor are they related to the rites of sufi brotherhoods. They are evidence of the overall transformation of local muslim society due to modern secular reforms. To better delimit the post-soviet patchwork of religions, we must abandon once and for all simplistic contrasts between traditional and modern islam, between an islam of the book and popular islam.

ABSTRACT:
This ethnographic essay investigates the relations between past and present forms of islam in the north caucasian republic of daghestan. Conversations culled from fieldwork in daghestani urban and rural spaces are used to elucidate the cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity of life in this region. Ethnographies in a bookstore, a shrine to the imam shamil, and a scholarly archive in makhachkala unfold against the historical background of daghestan's long-standing encounter with the arabo-islamic world. The essay explores how the post-soviet turn to post-secular islam represents an alternative to colonialism and a new way of making meaning in the present. It is intended as a contribution to islamic studies, modernity theory, and post-soviet union area studies.

ABSTRACT:
An american sociologist reports results of survey research conducted in 1993 among muslims in the five islamic autonomous republics of russia (n = 4,955). The data demonstrate that the strength of islam as both a religious and social institution varied regionally despite the shared experience of soviet anti-religious policies. Muslims in chechnya and dagestan were much more likely to report that they actively practiced islam than muslims living in kabardino-balkariya, tatarstan, and bashkortostan. Moroever, religious practice was high among non-traditional groups of chechentsy and avartsy. The young, the urban migrants, the highly educated, and men reported high levels of active worship. In bashkortostan, tatarstan, and kabardino-balkariya, in contrast, active religiosity was primarily confined to old, rural women with low levels of education. These differences, it is argued, are linked to the sufi islam tradition present in chechnya and dagestan but absent in the other muslim autonomous republics.

ABSTRACT:
The mountainous dagestan region has a unique historical development, likely based in independent cereal domestication and terraced agriculture. However, there is little to no data on the nature and timing of environmental changes throughout the settlement history of this region. In contrast to the much studied neighboring caucasus regions, dagestan remains mostly unexplored from the standpoint of paleoecology. Here we present a detailed radiocarbon-dated 185 cm long pollen record from the shotota swamp located in the mountainous zone of the eastern caucasus (dagestan). Peat and soil deposits of the swamp span most of the holocene from the neolithic to the middle ages, and this study, for the first time, presents an analysis of holocene vegetation history and the populating of the eastern caucasus. Our analysis reveals three basic stages of transformation of natural conditions: a stage of predominantly warm and dry climate, open meadow and steppe landscapes of 9200-7300 bp associated with the neolithic period; a warm and humid climate of 7300-6000 bp which accompanied the appearance of deciduous forests in the chalcolithic period; and cooling and several phases of humidification oscillations with the constant rise of pine forests with 5000 bp, which are associated with the bronze age, early iron age and middle ages. With the data obtained on the dynamics of vegetation, we conducted a coupled analysis of climate dynamics, populating and economy in dagestan. The results of the study show significant discrepancies in the timing and sequence of the expansion of tree species in the holocene in comparison with transcaucasia and the western caucasus. Despite the low settlement density pollen results reveal signs of agricultural development in the khunzakh plateau in the chalcolithic, the late bronze age and the early iron age that are not documented in archaeological surveys and require further investigation.

ABSTRACT:
The chokh archaeological culture is a specific local formation characterized by impressive technological and typological features chronologically tied to the mesolithic and neolithic of inner dagestan. At the neolithic stage this culture manifests itself as a multi-component formation composed of three diverse components. The triunity in this combination is unique for the caucasus. One of the key components of this culture is flint industry. Its striking originality is emphasized by such cultural elements as small levallois flat cores for flakes and four variants of points (arrowheads) of the chokh type. These specific features emerged in the culture of inner dagestan as early as the mesolithic and, without any major changes, persisted in the areas of medium-to-high plateaus (around 1200-1800 m above the sea level) and intermountain valleys. The second component of the neolithic chokh culture is reflected in ceramics which typologically and technologically coincide with the ceramics known in the early farming culture of the eastern trans-caucasus region (shulaveri-shomutepe). Finally, the third component is the method of exerting manual pressure (using a lever pressure device?) Employed to obtain standardized microblades. Each of the described cultural components has its own source and/or direction of cultural links and external influences. Local genetic roots are traced only for the above-said specific features of lithic industry. Technical and typological traits of ceramics point to links between the chokh population and the groups attributed to the trans-caucasus shulaveri-shomutepe culture. The northern vector of cultural impacts (northern relative to the dagestan region), which is opposite to the eastern trans-caucasus direction of contacts, manifests itself in the method of exerting manual pressure in flint knapping that was introduced in the technological arsenal of the mountainous neolithic represented by the chokh culture.

ABSTRACT:
The qualitative composition and quantitative content of mineral substances in the soils and fruits of prunus armeniaca l. And malus domestica borkh. Cultivated in the environmental conditions of the plains and foothills of central daghestan has been estimated. The adaptation of apricot and apple trees to the natural factors of the lower foothills results in higher sugar concentrations in their fruits in comparison with trees growing on plains; the apricot and apple trees growing on lower foothills concentrate more ca and p, while the contents of k, na, mg, and cu in their fruits are reduced. Plants of the same species growing on soils with different contents of mineral substances differ by the total content of macro-and microelements in their fruits but accumulate roughly equivalent levels of p, na, ca, cu, ni, and pb.

ABSTRACT:
This paper analyses the contemporary structure and functioning of dagestan's rural communities in a context of internal russian migration, particularly to the cities of western siberia. The concepts of transnationalism and translocality are deployed as a theoretical framework to analyse the migrant and his social world without detaching ourselves from the donor community, the djamaat. It is argued that the dagestan rural community, in the course of the migration processes of recent decades, can no longer be viewed merely as a local social entity. A new translocal community has emerged, organized on the principle of the `global village', that consists of migrants, their family members and non-migrants remaining in the home villages. Translocal migrants, existing simultaneously in several geographically separated points, continue to construct their identity and their social networks, a process that fosters a sense of belonging to a dagestani village. The donor rural community is an important space where migrants can demonstrate personal successes and new entrepreneurial and philanthropic economic activities. Migrants invest not only in their own households but also help their native villages as a whole through entrepreneurial activity and financial support. In addition, the key moments of life remain rooted in the village. Migrants prefer to find a marriage partner from their home village. The home village is also seen to be the only acceptable burial place for deceased migrants. A major role in the consolidation of a translocal djamaat is played by internet resources such as social networks and messenger programmes, which construct social networks and maintain communication among fellow countrymen in real time. This preference for preserving ties to one's rural locality even after resettlement out of the village and the republic of dagestan, as well as the maintenance of translocal links, allow us to speak of a new social entity: the translocal community.

ABSTRACT:
The article examines the mechanisms of functioning of internet communication and social networks in the translocal rural communities of dagestan, a russian federation region in the north caucasus, whose members have been participating in the labor migration to industrial russian cities. Huge distances and various sociocultural and economic differences between the sending and the receiving societies pose a challenge to the unity of the rural community, djamaat. Rural identity is salient for migrants: they preserve the principle of rural endogamy, bury all the dead migrants in their village, spend money and time on the development of the village, and create public organizations of fellow villagers. The article focuses on the practice of using mobile social networks- facebook and its russian counterparts-by transmigrants, their families, and fellow villagers. Social media provide everyday family communication and serve as a platform for performing important social rites such as finding a bride, matchmaking, remitting money for condolences, as well as transferring important information between migrants and those living in the village. Rural chats consolidate the community and formulate the idea of the unity and also become power and economic resources for migrants. At the same time, the villagers' chats are the places where the laws of reputation are at work, therefore they can also demonstrate positive or negative social capital and carry a danger for migrants, especially for women.

ABSTRACT:
Galactomannan (gum), a water-soluble polysaccharide, is widely used as a gelling agent in liquids, including in the oil and gas industry for hydraulic fracturing. The most effective source of this valuable plant material is seeds of guar (cyamopsis tetragonoloba (l.) Taub.), a legume crop new for russia. Although in recent years progress has been made in the selection of guar varieties adapted to the conditions of the russian federation, the question of the most appropriate region for the cultivation of this crop remains open. The purpose of the study was to investigate how a region and technology of guar cultivation can affect the main indicators of the final target product: the content and viscosity of guar gum extracted from the seeds of various guar genotypes. To understand this, ecogeographical tests of 13 guar accessions from the vir collection were conducted at the experimental stations of the vavilov institute (vir), where climatic conditions correspond to the temperature requirements of the crop. To compare the properties of gum extracted from the seeds of various genotypes, a fast-tracked laboratory method was suggested allowing gum extracts to be obtained for assessing their viscosity. The method allows fast screening of the breeding material and selecting guar genotypes with beneficial properties of guar gum which are in demand by the oil industry. Applying the fast laboratory method for assessing the properties of gum in seeds of 13 guar varieties showed that the content and viscosity of gum of the same variety vary greatly depending on growing conditions. The same set of 13 guar accessions was grown in 2018 at the volgograd, astrakhan, dagestan and kuban vir experimental stations. As a result, the maximum viscosity values were obtained for the seeds reproduced at the astrakhan region, where the guar was grown on irrigated lands. On the other hand, the maximum gum content in the seeds of all accessions was recorded when they were grown in the volgograd region. The results showed that the guar gum extracted from seeds of guar plants grown in the russian federation can be used as a gelling agent in the processes of intensification of oil production by the method of hydraulic fracturing. This experience is new to the russian federation.

ABSTRACT:
The annual legume crop clusterbean (cyamopsis tetragonoloba (l.) Taub.) Is a promising crop for cultivation in the south of russia. In 2018, phytosanitary examinations of clusterbean fields (13 collection accessions) were conducted in five vir branches (krasnodar territory, dagestan, astrakhan and volgograd regions). At all points, several types of leaf spots were observed on clusterbean leaves and symptoms of plant damage by fungi of the genus alternaria nees prevailed. Using microbiological methods and next-generation sequencing (ngs) of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer two (its2), the species composition of micromycetes was identified. It was found that the micromycetes alternaria spp. In different ecological and geographical conditions of the south of russia cause two main types of leaf spots: the typical (beige and brown round spots, usually accompanied by concentric zonality) and brown spot (small brown bulging merging spots). Overwhelmingly the damage to leaf tissues is caused by the fungus a. Tenuissima (nees \& t. Nees : fr.) Wiltshire. A quite numerous accompanying mycoflora (first of all, fungi of the genus fusarium link) was also detected. A. Cyamopsidis rangaswami \& a.v. Rao, one of the most harmful guar pathogens in the countries where the main acreage is located (india, pakistan, usa), was not found on clusterbean fields in russia. The accessions of clusterbean differ in degree of damage by a. Tenuissima that causes alternaria leaf blight. Differential interaction of parasite and plant host was revealed. Therefore, to prevent epiphytotics, varieties protected by non-identical resistance genes should be grown. At all vir branches, accessions k-52568 (argentina) and k-52569 (pakistan) were weakly damaged by alternaria leaf blight, and some accessions were resistant only in the environmental conditions of one or two experimental stations. The accessions studied were heterogeneous in pathogen resistance, which allows selecting disease-resistant lines from most of the collection accessions. Thus, in various vir branches, plants without symptoms of disease were selected from accessions k-52571, k-52573 and k-52580, and seeds were collected to create new donors of disease resistance.

ABSTRACT:
The study of agricultural terraces in mountainous dagestan that date to the middle ages revealed the polygenetic character of anthropogenic soils, which reflects the main stages of their evolution. In light of their long-term burial, the soil layers of the preanthropogenic stage of evolution were characterized by fairly high values of biological activity, with the exception of the biomass of fungal mycelium, a small amount of which remained. At the early agrogenic stage, soil plowing without irrigation did not significantly change their microbiological properties; however, the increase in urease activity in some studied profiles may indicate that cattle fertilizers were applied in some areas of the terraces. During the little ice age (the 16-18th centuries a.d.) The terraces were abandoned, which led to the accumulation of organic carbon in the soils as a result of the fallow process, as well as an increase in their enzymatic activity. The second agrogenic stage with irrigation was characterized by a noticeable growth in the active microbial biomass, the soil phosphatase activity, and, in particular, the urease activity, which may indicate that farming was intensive and organic fertilizers were applied. In the last 20 years, the development of terraces under natural conditions led to a noticeable growth in the biological activity of upper fallow horizons. However, the urease activity significantly decreased in nonirrigated areas, whereas the indicators of microbial biomass remained at the same level.

ABSTRACT:
This article describes the condition and spread of one of the most mobile forms of pastoralism, transhumance, as well as factors and transition pathways that have taken place in the pastoral systems of the north caucasus. The weakening of centralization and control over local economies, as well as the cessation of subsidies to collective and state farms in the 1990s, led to the destruction of state-regulated transhumance. At the same time, traditional institutions and local forms of social organization, such as ethnic groups, tribal alliances, and family associations, are playing an important role. This study is based on mapping of pasture use, analysis of statistical data, and interviews with shepherds, municipal authority representatives, and government officials from regional agricultural departments. It describes the factors promoting or limiting transhumance in 4 regions (dagestan, chechnya, north ossetia-alania, and karachay-cherkessia), including ethnicity, land tenure, the status of privatization of agricultural land, and centralization of power. Leading actors and institutions in 3 periods, pre-revolutionary, soviet, and post-soviet, are considered, with a more detailed analysis of the last period right up to present times. The role of resettlement of people from the mountains to the plains in the soviet period, which contributed to the development of transhumance in the modern period, is emphasized. Institutional hybrids are discussed, including formal state and informal (traditional and new) rules to regulate the use of pastures during the transition from the soviet central planning system to market relations.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. Polymorphism is the result of evolutionary processes and is inherited, associated with biodiversity and modified by natural selection and functions to preserve various forms of population. It is economically advantageous to find genes that can be used in breeding in such a way as to increase the fertility of animals in different natural geographical zones, since the adaptive abilities of organisms are complicated. In this regard, the purpose of this study was to study the genetic potential of sheep of different breeds bred in various ecological and geographical regions of the north caucasus with pasture-pasture and pasture-stall conditions of sheep breeding. Material and methods. Genotyping was undertaken of sheep of different breeds contained in various natural and climatic zones of the republic of dagestan and the most arid region of stavropol territory in the zone of risky agriculture where the climate is sharply continental. Genotyping in the loci of the genes of differential growth factor (gdf9) and bone morphogenetic protein (bmp15) was carried out by pcr-pdrf (polymorphism of the lengths of restriction fragments) by cutting dna using endonuclease restriction and further analysis of the size of the resulting pcr fragments. The genetic structure of genes has been studied by methods of genetic and statistical analysis of the data obtained. Conclusion. The genetic structure of sheep populations of different breeds bred in the foothills of the republic of dagestan and the arid region of stavropol territory was studied for the first time. Information obtained on the role of the degree of genetic variability of sheep of different breeds provides data which can contribute to the ecological well-being of herds and the status characterising the signs of multiple birth rates is also determined. This will further improve and significantly accelerate breeding work with livestock, since an important task of further increasing the efficiency of the industry is the reproduction of the herd together with a simultaneous increase in the productivity of animals.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. One of the important tasks in solving the problem of improving the efficiency of sheep breeding is the rational use of fodder lands in the north caucasus and the south of russia, a significant part of which is located in different natural and climatic conditions. The complexity of solutions lies in insufficient knowledge of the mechanisms of adaptation of farm animals, in particular sheep, to the ecological and geographical features of these regions. The purpose of this research was to study the genetic polymorphism of genes, the degree of genetic variability and immune status in sheep of different breeds, since genetic polymorphism is a measure of its adaptability and the hematopoietic function of blood is the basis of the life of the organism. Material and methods. The genetic structure of the gh/hae iii, gdf9/asplei genes and immune status, was studied by the methods of genetic-statistical and immune analysis in sheep of different breeds kept in different climatic zones of dagestan and the krasnodar territory. Results. As a result of dna genotyping of the studied samples of sheep of different breeds, it was found that polymorphism of gh/haeiii, gdwasplei genes is represented by three genotype variants: homozygous gh/haeiii(aa), gh/haeiii(bb); gdf9/asplei(aa), gdf9/asplei(gg); heterozygous gh/haeiii(ab); gdf9/asplei(ag) and two alleles: a and b - of the gh/haeiii gene; a and g - gdf9/asplei gene with different frequency of occurrence, respectively. Conclusion. For the first time, genetic variability has been studied in the context of the immune status of sheep populations of different breeds bred in the foothills of the republic of dagestan and krasnodar territory. The information obtained about the role of the degree of genetic variability and the immune status of sheep of different breeds is answered in the formation of adaptive-compensatory mechanisms to specific conditions of the breeding environment. A deeper study of the adaptive characteristics of sheep of different breeds for their further improvement allows the use of molecular genetic and hematological methods.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. The environmental-epidemiological monitoring of socially significant pathology and its forecasting for the development of effective preventive measures and environmental quality management methods in the republic of dagestan material and methods. An epidemiological analysis of public health indicators was carried out in 41 municipalities and 10 urban districts of the republic of dagestan. This was carried out through current and retrospective analysis of regional health indicators, medical-geographical and mathematical statistical analysis. The data sources for the main indicators reflect the epidemiological situation in the republic of dagestan from 1997 to 2016. Results. An understanding of the status of the main epidemiological indicators of the condition of public health of the region's rural and urban population was obtained and future dynamics predicted. An integrated assessment of the well-being of the territory of the republic revealed areas and cities with adverse trends in public health in the main groups of socially significant and environmentally-related pathologies. Conclusions. An integrated assessment of the state of well-being in the republic of dagestan by groups of epidemiological indicators of general morbidity, general morbidity of various age groups of the population, socially significant and environmentally-caused morbidity, as well as a forecast of their dynamics, revealed adverse trends in public health in rural populations of tsuntinskiy, akhtynskiy, gunibskiy, kulinskiy, tabasaranskiy, nogayskiy, novolakskiy, suleiman-stalskiy, khasavyurtskiy, tarumovskiy districts and of the cities of kaspiysk, dagestanskie ogni, makhachkala and kizilyurt. An analysis of the sources of supplies of drinking water revealed a positive correlation between heavy metals content and adverse trends in socially significant pathology in the regions of northern dagestan.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. The aim of the research is to consider the medical and social aspects of artificially terminating pregnancy in the republic of dagestan. Material and methods. To achieve this goal, we have created a database of the cases of artificial abortion in the republic of dagestan. Statistical processing of the results of the study was carried out using software packages like statistica and excel. Results. The total number of abortions for the study period was 157526 cases, of which 26\% of cases were spontaneous abortions, 8.9\% of cases were abortions for medical reasons. During the period under review, there was an increase in the number of spontaneous abortions and abortions due to medical indications by 170\% and 108.6\%, respectively. There is the prevalence of abortions of the pregnancy of up to 12 week-period, including mini-abortions, the average percentage of the total number of abortions for the study period was 90\%. In the republic of dagestan, the average annual intensive standardized abortion rate was 14.67 cases per 1,000 women of childbearing age women of childbearing age (wca). And among the urban population, this number is higher, and amounted to 25.57 \%o against 6.25 \%o in rural areas. The highest values of the average long-term intensive frequency of abortions are observed in the cities of kizilyurt, derbent, makhachkala, kaspiisk; in the countrysides: dakhadayevsky, tarumovsky, laksky and babaurtovsky districts. Conclusion. The problem of abortion, despite the steady tendency to reduce their number, still needs to be solved because it is the leading cause of maternal death in russia, inflammatory diseases of the genitals, infertility, and it also adversely affects the course of subsequent pregnancies and births, increasing the frequency miscarriage, maternal and perinatal pathology.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. To conduct a comparative analysis of the self-assessment of health by urban and rural residents of the republic of dagestan, using as examples the city of makhachkala and the untsukulskiy district. Material and methods. Sociological research methods were employed on the basis of questionnaires. Results. According to the results of the study the majority of the residents of makhachkala and the untsukulskiy district surveyed - 71\% and 68.2\% respectively gave positive assessments of their health. In both samples, the proportion of respondents who rated their health as ``mediocre'' and ``bad'' increased with age. In rural areas the number of young and middle-aged respondents who assessed their health as worse exceeded the number of city dwellers of the same age. Among male respondents, 77.8\% in makhachkala and 74.9\% in the untsukulskiy district gave a positive self-assessment of health and among the female population, 66.7\% and 62.93\% respectively. Conclusion. Self-assessment of health is a tool recommended by the world health organization for monitoring health within selected population groups. The slight difference between the assessment of their health by urban and rural residents is due to differences in lifestyle and standard of living, access to medical as well as cultural, leisure and other types of services.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. Determination of the importance of the ecological vector in ensuring the sustainable development of the republic of dagestan. Materials and methods. A historical and comparative analysis was carried out using official statistical data of rosstat and data from state reports on the state and on environmental protection. Results. The author proposes that there be a focus on the formation of public and individual ecological consciousness of citizens, the involvement of the population in various environmental actions, the use of alternative energy sources and the development of tourism in the republic, taking into account the proper level of protection of natural objects. Conclusion. The republic of dagestan, due to its geographical and climatic features, has more potential in the field of sustainable development than any other region of our country, but it seems that the best results require the application of all the actions listed herein aimed at strengthening the role of the environmental component of sustainable development.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. To carry out a comparative analysis of self-rated health, medical activity, and satisfaction with the quality of medical care in public health institutions by residents of rural settlements of the untsukul district, republic of dagestan. Methods. The study was conducted by the method of questioning 2643 respondents, among them 1453 women and 1181 men. Results. According to the results of the survey, the majority of the interviewed residents of untsukul district (68.2\%) are satisfied with their health. Medical activity of the population at the time of the study was 60.6\%. As to respondents who applied to the medical institutions of the untsukul district during this period, 13.5\% are not satisfied with the quality of medical care in public health institutions, 23.5\% are fully satisfied, 30\% are not fully satisfied. Conclusion. A social survey in the form of a questionnaire is one of the most effective methods of obtaining information about the self-rated health of the population. Timely analysis of medical activity of the population, its satisfaction with the quality of medical care will improve the efficiency of the health system.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. The prevalence of some factors affecting the health status of residents of 14 rural settlements in the untsukul district of the republic of dagestan is established. The total number of respondents was 2,634, including 1,453 women and 1,181 men. The survey involved people aged 18 to 97 years. Methods. The study was carried out by a survey of respondents using a questionnaire, including questions on the assessment of their self-preserving behavior. Results. The prevalence of risk factors for health associated with lifestyle - smoking, regularity and quality of food, physical activity. To preserve their own health, the majority of respondents (55\%) consider a healthy lifestyle to be determined, but the practice of self-preserving behavior is not widely spread. Regular meals (at least three times a day) were noted by 51.3\% of respondents. The share of respondents, regularly (every day) engaged in physical culture and sports, was 27\%. The territorial differentiation of inhabited localities of untsukul region is revealed by the prevalence of factors of self-preserving behavior. Conclusion. The obtained information on the way of life of residents of the untsukul district can be used in the development of medical and social programs aimed at improving the quality of life of the population, creating a culture of self-preserving behavior.

ABSTRACT:
Individual household plot was and is one of the most common forms of organization of agricultural production in dagestan, which provides employment in a labor-surplus region, as well as the income growth for rural residents of the southern region. In the 60-80s of the twentieth century individual household plots retained their significance despite the criticism and certain administrative obstacles, the rhetoric about the ``withering away'' of individual household plots and the primacy of social production. In some industries individual household plots received their further development, especially after the enaction of certain decrees and orders in 1964, 1965, 1977 that reduced the pressure on the villagers who had household plots. There was the growth of sheepheads, especially in mountainous areas, the reactivation of farms, and the slow expansion of land for individual household plots. They had the trade growth in agriculture and its geographical expansion. It was noted that the commercial orientation of individual household plots was higher than in social farms, their material and labor costs paid off due to higher incomes. Such incomes were provided by the production of those products that were produced by little or not produced by collective and state farms, and therefore products were in great demand. The difficulty of collecting statistical data on the development of individual plots was noted, since they were rarely cited in statistical compilations.

ABSTRACT:
The publication discusses peasant everyday life in dagestan during the period of reconstruction of the country's national economy. The great importance of the resettlement of the highlanders on the plain in improving the situation of low-power peasant farms was noted. The influence of the agrarian transformations of soviet power on the daily life of peasants in the period under study is characterized. Fierce resistance of the prosperous part of the peasantry to land-water reform and collective farm construction in the republic is shown.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. The aim of the research is to analyze the reasons for the migration of mountain people to the plain, the identification of the most significant stages of the resettlement movement in the republic of dagestan, the identification of ways to preserve and revive the mountain villages of dagestan. Discussion. At present, the outflow of population from mountainous areas to flat land is actively continuing which leads to the abandonment of dozens of mountain villages. Therefore, in modern conditions, the urgent task is to preserve and revive the mountain villages of dagestan. For this, first of all, the creation of a developed infrastructure, high-quality medical care and education, as well as the revival of traditional forms of land use, horticulture and cattle breeding, creation of new jobs are necessary in mountainous areas. The traditional habitat should be attractive for young people. The understanding of the problem of preservation and revival of the mountainous regions of dagestan exists not only at the governmental level but also in dagestan society as a whole. It is shown that the natural-historical and cultural complexes of dagestan should be used for the development of various types of tourism, especially cultural-cognitive and ethno-tourism, ecological and religious tourism. Conclusion. Almost every ancient mountain village of dagestan is actually an ethnographic museum in the open air, therefore the development of the tourism industry, in particular cultural-cognitive and ethno-tourism, will contribute to the preservation and revival of ancient auls in the republic.

ABSTRACT:
The use of woody biomass obtained from pruning and removal of perennial agricultural plantations for energy needs is a relatively new direction, which is now actively explored and developed in europe. In russia, horticulture and viticulture is also a traditional direction of agriculture in the southern regions, in particular, in the republic of dagestan. Dagestan is a volatile region with a variety of problems in the fuel and energy complex. The solution to these problems may become the use of renewable energy resources in the region. The paper presents the methodology for assessment of bioenergy resources in the region with the use of spatial analysis. The main purpose is to determine the optimal economically and technologically available energy technology for the estimated energy resource. The results show the high importance of social and economic factors for the development of renewable energy in the region, which is not typical for the other regions of russia and should be taken into account in the further development of the methodology of multi-stage bioenergy resource assessment.

ABSTRACT:
Since the end of the twentieth century, the climate system of the planet has been experiencing significant changes in air temperature, due to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and changes in the precipitation regime. Our research covers the caspian region of russia, which belongs to the southern regions of the country, where one of the highest rates of air temperature increase is observed. The caspian region includes the astrakhan region, kalmykia and dagestan. To assess the upcoming changes, the average daily air temperature and precipitation were taken, as well as the average monthly values of water vapor elasticity, total cloud cover for the points of astrakhan, elista, yashkul, lagan, makhachkala, buinaksk, derbent and akhty. To assess changes in natural areas, we used the budyko radiation dryness index. Changes in agriculture were estimated using the selyaninov hydro-climatic index. It was revealed that the upcoming changes in the climate system, based on the data of the ensemble of models (cmip5), will lead to an increase in the radiation balance, in the average annual amount of precipitation, in the sum of temperatures of more than 10 degrees c by the end of the century. Analysis of the dynamics of the budyko index showed that by the end of this century, the astrakhan region will still belong to the zone of subtropical deserts. Depending on which climate scenario the global climate system will develop, the region of kalmykia may move from the zone of subtropical deserts to the zone of subtropical semi-deserts. The territory of dagestan currently belongs to the zone of subtropical semi-desert. With the development of the climate scenario rcp 4.5, this territory will tend to the climatic conditions of the subtropical steppe zone (k = 2-3). In the development of the rcp8. 5 scenario, the territory of dagestan will remain a zone of subtropical semi-deserts, with a tendency to transition to a zone of subtropical steppes. The readings of the selyaninov hydro-climatic index, calculated for the period 2011-2030, indicate a continued deterioration of the moisture turnover conditions for the astrakhan region and dagestan in all scenarios. The humidity regime of the astrakhan region will gradually deteriorate. As a result, irrigation - type agriculture will dominate in the astrakhan region, while dry agriculture will dominate in dagestan. According to the rcp 2.6 and rcp 8.5 scenarios, kalmykia will move from an irrigation farming zone to a dry farming zone. By the end of the century, the humidity conditions of the astrakhan region and dagestan will deteriorate even more. The astrakhan region and dagestan will remain in the zone of irrigation and dry farming, respectively. Kalmykia, according to the rcp 2.6 scenario, remains in the dry farming zone by the end of the century, according to the rcp 4.5 and rcp 8.5 scenarios, it again passes into the irrigation zone. It is obvious that some improvement associated with an increase in the amount of precipitation per year will contribute to the favorable development of natural systems (with a tendency to move from deserts to semi-deserts). At the same time, the conditions for the development of agriculture in most part of the caspian region will deteriorate.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. To carry out an ecological and faunistic review of weevils of the tribe baridini schoencherr, 1836 of dagestan; study of the ecology and chorology of the most harmful species, the green rutabaga baride (aulacobaris coerulescens scop.). Material and methods. The work was based on observations and materials obtained in 1996-2020 in various regions of dagestan, using classical methods of field study of invertebrates. Collection materials and data from different authors for the period from 1872 to 2010 were also used. Stationary studies of the ecology of aulacobaris coerulescens scopoli, 1763 were conducted on the basis of agricultural cooperatives and peasant farms of buynaksky, levashinsky, akushinsky and gergebilsky districts of dagestan. Results. Studies have shown that the fauna of the tribe baridini in dagestan is represented by 26 species from 8 genera. In zoogeographic terms, it is composed of 7 complexes with the main core being formed by steppe species. In the attitudinal range, the fauna of lowland dagestan is the richest, where 20 species live. Trophic specialization is dominated by broad oligophages; the main food base is the brassicaceae family. The most important agricultural species and dangerous pest of cabbage in dagestan is the green rutabaga baride (aulacoboris coerulescens scopoli, 1763). The features of its ecology and distribution were studied and a phenological table and a map of the range were compiled. Conclusion. The fauna of the baridini tribe of dagestan is rich and varied. It is represented by various zoogeographical and ecological complexes in all attitudinal zones of dagestan. Phenological data and a distribution map of rutabaga baride can be used to optimize control measures and minimize impacts on ecosystems.

ABSTRACT:
The article examines the appellative vocabulary of the avar and dargin languages related to agriculture. Attention is paid to the analysis of folk geographical terms, especially agroonymic terms that form the to-ponymy of two ethnoregions of dagestan. The analysis of the presented materials of the avar and dargin lan-guages shows that the vocabulary associated with agri- culture is well preserved in microtoponymy. The novelty of the study is seen in the fact that a large number of words related to ancient farming systems indicates the long preservation of archaic methods of land cultivation in the territory of the avars and dargins, which in turn led to the preservation of many farming terms and their consolidation in microtoponymy. The relevance of the study is due to the fact that the field material collected by the authors in the mountainous areas of accident and darga is introduced into scientific circulation, and a classification of nine semantic subgroups ofagroonymic terms is proposed. It is also important to analyze the material in the aspect of comparing farming terms in different dialects. The article describes the experience of the authors' long-term work in the study ofavar and dargin microtoponyms.

ABSTRACT:
The article deals with a craniological series from the 3rd (ortoklinskoye) gotsatlinskoye burial ground located in mountainous dagestan and dating back to the 10th-12th centuries. Based on the results of intragroup and intergroup comparisons, a conclusion is made about the differences between this sample and known paleoanthropological series from the territory of north ossetia, ingushetia, chechnya, dagestan and georgia. The reason for this difference is a strong morphological heterogeneity, which, taking into account the peculiarities of the archaeological material, allows us to conclude that this burial ground was a necropolis of a lag farm (captives, a group of the population with limited rights).

ABSTRACT:
The article discusses the land-use problem of mountain and semi-desert landscapes of dagestan caused by the need to improve the ecologization of traditional pastures as well as perspective tourism and recreational land use. Aim. A comprehensive geographic study of land use in the republic is crucial for the formation of ecologically sustainable distillation and nomad livestock and tourist-recreational land use on the natural, zonal and high-belt mountain-semi-desert landscapes that are not fully developed and are not suitable for farming. Discussion. Ecological and economic effects are revealed due to the combined use of semi-desert-mountain pastures and tourist-recreational areas represented by the population carrying capacity, the ecologization of pasture land use and a significant increase in the total livestock production. Improved combined interzonal use of lands with different natural rhythms of vegetation development contributes, first of all, to maintaining the equilibrium and integrity of the regional ecological system; secondly, to the ecological orientation of pasture-livestock and tourist-recreational land use; and thirdly, to the restoration and the functioning of the quality of natural semi-desert and mountain pasture lands. Conclusion. Ecological and landscape improvement within mountain pasture land use is proposed on the basis of the ecological and economic efficiency of the annual cycle of high-altitude sheep keeping with the regular change of pasture lands of different productivity levels by different sex and age groups of pastured livestock.

ABSTRACT:
Given the lack of reliable first-hand sources, nobody has yet traced the modern history of islamic charitable endowments in the north caucasus under early soviet rule.. Is article is one of the first attempts to conduct such research in daghestan. In this republic waqf foundations were legally acknowledged until 23 january 1927, when a decree turned them into national state property that would be divided among their previous holders in cooperatives and kolkhozes. Is it possible to recover the early soviet history of waqf in the period 1920-1927, when it functioned under the protection of state law, while remaining almost completely exempt from state control and registration? What can be said on competing visions of waqf and its place in the soviet discourse of mountaineers' survival and modernity? What role did it play in the countryside on the eve of collectivization? To answer these questions the author focuses on village communities which, as he argues, constituted crucial level of post-revolutionary islamic endowments.. Is research introduces a unique waqf register of the 1920s from the village of dibgashi. It relies on a broad range of muslim and soviet sources in the arabic, caucasian and russian languages, including oral histories gathered by the author among contemporary villagers in mountain daghestan.

ABSTRACT:
Research of the issues of preservation the traditional culture of the peoples of the russian federation, especially dagestan, in the process of integration with neighboring state formations in 1990-2010 is one of the most important directions in the formation of a modern state strategy to preserve the linguistic and cultural wealth of russia. The relevance of the study is due to the need to carefully study the processes of integration of dagestan into the common space of russia, transformation of its traditional foundations under the influence of the globalization and russification processes and their results. The main purpose of this paper is a brief analysis of the current state of traditional culture and daily life of the peoples of dagestan and its transformation under the influence of russian and world cultures, as well as of the global information openness in 1991-2000. On the basis of field ethnographic material, non-fiction, periodicals, sociology opinions and data on the internet in the article traced the transformation of the external appearance of the inhabitants of the dagestan, their houses, national cuisine, the ways of the celebration associated with the traditional spiritual life and others. The prerequisites and reasons for these changes are revealed, concrete ways of cultural transfer of russian, european and eastern traditions to dagestan, and the degree of exposure to their globalization are also discovered. It is also noted that the loss of the traditional heritage of the dagestan peoples is associated with an increase in the level mobility among the middle generation and youth in educational, labor and leisure, as well as the transfer of cultural values they perceived in foreign countries and the subsequent replacement of their own. This leads to the upbringing by cultural migrants of new generation of children in accordance with russian or european cultural standards. The main reason for this is an attempt to facilitate the further integration of adolescents and young people into the globalizing world. In addition, the process of polarization of the dagestan society in the field of spiritual heritage transfer has been revealed. On the one hand, they raise their children mainly within the framework of the dagestan traditions, strengthened by islamic views (in some cases they turn into the extreme degree of muslim radicalism), and on the other hand - european and russian etiquette and culture (they often completely perceive their norms of morality, behavior, etc.). Moreover, the second group has a significant advantage, and consequently, is the source of innovative ideas that lead to oblivion of the traditional foundations of the life of the dagestanis and the deformation of the national mentality. It is emphasized that despite the intensive introduction of cultural and other innovations in post-soviet times, the modern urban and especially rural population of dagestan is trying to preserve a number of components of its traditional material and spiritual culture.

ABSTRACT:
The study of religious and political attitudes of young people at the all-russian and regional levels is always of great interest for the research community. The paper is based on the results of a mass political and sociological survey of 1 220 young people (aged from 18 to 25 years old) of the republic of dagestan in 2017. The sociological survey was conducted throughout dagestan, among young men and women living in cities and rural areas. The study touches upon the assessment of religious revival, the characteristics of the religious situation in dagestan, the aggravation of the religious situation in the republic, the youth's preferences for social and state organization, the orientation of contacts with islamic states, the attitudes of youth to isis and the likelihood of their participation in the ranks of isis and other religion-based terrorist organizations, the attitude of youth towards the military actions of russia against isis in syria, the sources of religious information, reflecting the religious component on interethnic relations. The study shows that the level of religiosity among dagestan youth is at a high level, which is especially evident in some issues, and this causes some concern. However, this phenomenon is not critical. Young people remain oriented towards secularism in the state system. For young people, the economic and political factor is more important than the religious one, which has more spiritual and moral significance. The youth is aware of and supports the foreign policy course of the country's leadership and approves the military-political policy in syria.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. The aim of the study is to show the possibility and efficiency of large-scale industrial production of microalgae in the republic of dagestan for the development of agriculture (feed for animals and poultry) and other technological applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries for the production of algalin flour (eco bread), polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3, omega-6) physiologically necessary for humans, biologically active substances (astaxanthin, phycocyanin), new-generation antibiotics, biofuels and other high added value biotechnological products. The problems of using microalgae for bioremediation of the environment, in particular, purification of geothermal waters from phenols before discharging into the sewage system are considered. Methods. Microalgae are grown in closed and open type plants. Valuable algae components can be extracted using supercritical fluid technology of continuous action. Results. We give a comparative evaluation of the efficiency of using microalgae as a biological raw material in comparison with traditionally used oilseeds. Conclusion. For dagestan, located on the shore of the caspian sea, with its warm climate and an abundance of solar and geothermal energy, the development of this technology is a task of great economic importance. The advantages of microalgae technologies are the basis for the creation of large-scale production of microalgae in southern russia. Biotechnology in dagestan can become not only profitable, but also a high-tech and innovative industry.

ABSTRACT:
The article examines various aspects of the recently revealed archival document of the central committee of the all-union communist party (bolsheviks) on the plan of repressive policy against the soviet peasantry ``on measures to eliminate kulak farms in the areas of continuous collectivization.'' The author notes that the process of liquidation of kulaks as class, or of depeasantrification, as it is often designated in the historical literature, has been well studied. The first and rather timid attempts to assess the problem in the terms of individual ``deformations of socialism'' date to the turn the 1990s. At present, the attention is mostly focused on the regional aspect, as over the past three decades there has been made available a complex of sources from local archives, which was previously in closed storage. The article analyzes preconditions of the protest sentiments in the course of mass collectivization undertaken by party bodies in the center and in the regions, as well as harsh suppression of possible peasant uprisings by punitive bodies, identification and persecution of the instigators. Examination of official party documents on collectivization permits to identify the ideological, social, and economic criteria for ranking soviet peasants among kulaks. It is concluded that liquidation of kulaks as class on the territory of the ussr was conducted in a very short time and in two stages. At the first stage, in january - march 1930, repressions were to be carried out in the economically developed regions: the black earth region, the middle and lower volga region, kazakhstan, ukraine, belarus, north caucasus, dagestan, ural, siberia. The second stage spread them to other regions of soviet russia. The author notes an inconsistency in the thesis of positive economic consequences of mass collectivization and elimination of kulaks as class for industrialization. Taking into account their consequences, the author proposes to consider these two complementary processes initiated by the leadership of the cpsu (b) as a preventive campaign to intimidate the rural population in order to return to the methods of surplus appropriation via formation of the collective farm system. It has been revealed that j.v. Stalin's plans, in accordance with the marxist-leninist doctrine, included a rapid change in socio-economic status of peasants: from relatively free farmers, producers of agricultural products entitled to manage their crops (after paying the taxes) to hired workers, in other words, proletarians. According to the author, the large-scale famine of the first half of the 1930s was a direct consequence of the so-called ``revolutionary transformations in agriculture,'' the victims of which are to be accurately calculated.

ABSTRACT:
Drawing on unique interviews with former jihadists from russia's autonomous republic of dagestan, this article is the first to examine the impact of ethnicity on jihadist groups' methods of organization and operations, primarily in terms of their target selection, local support, and recruitment and leadership policies. It distinguishes between largely monoethnic rural jamaatsor jihadist groupsand multiethnic urban jamaats, pointing to the contested nature of ethnicity, particularly in the latter group. It examines the steps taken by the leadership of urban jamaats to overcome ethnic cleavages and avoid interethnic tension both within the jihadists' ranks and with regard to the local population. The article illustrates that, as a divisive phenomenon in multiethnic urban jamaats, ethnic identity has been deliberately downplayed by the leadership of these groups at the expense of strengthening supra-ethnic salafi-jihadist identity. The article also highlights the significance of ethnic identity in jihadist groups, in spite of it being contradictory to salafi-jihadist doctrine.

ABSTRACT:
Mikhail chlenov, secretary general of the euro-asian jewish congress, introduces the classic volume mountain jews, edited by iosef begun and valerii dymshits. This essay presents the significance of the group as well as the book. Mountain or ``highland'' jews have cultural roots in the history of a far-flung persian jewish archipelago. Many jews from mountainous villages in dagestan and azerbaijan in the post-soviet period have fled long-established rural communities, often landing in moscow as outsiders within an already ``outsider'' group.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. To conduct studies on the content of radionuclides sr-90, cs-13(7), pb-210 and determine the total beta-activity in objects (samples) of the external environment, as well as to investigate the effect of radioactive isotopes on the spread of bovine leukemia in the republic of dagestan. Materials and methods. Samples (haylage, natural grass, silage, compound feed, milk, etc.) That were obtained from various locations of the republic of dagestan were used for radiological research. The method of research was radiochemical analysis using the universal spectrometric complex ``gamma plus'' etc. For bovine leukemia the principal material was the reporting data of the republican veterinary laboratory, supplemented by our own research from 1988 to 2008. The research was carried out by generally recognized methods in serology and hematology. Results. After the studies were conducted, a high content of radionuclides sr-90 and cs-137 was found in environmental objects from 1986-198, and the activity of nuclide pb-210 in the ecosystem of the republic increased tenfold compared to 1985. An important indicator such as the total beta-activity in the republic also increased in the period (from 1986-1988) after the accident at the chernobyl nuclear power station. In 1988, we recorded the maximum number (32.2\%) of infected animals with the bovine leukemia virus and in subsequent years the percentage of hemo-diseased heads of cattle in the farms of the republic increased. Conclusion. Thus, there is a causal relationship between the activity of radionuclides and the decrease in the immune status of animals, which may lead to the increase in the spread of bovine leukemia in the republic.

ABSTRACT:
The priority task for domestic agribusiness is to ensure conditions for stable economic growth. To meet international standards, russian farmers need to maximize production efficiency and increase the level of profitability of agricultural products. Positive economic dynamics in the agricultural sector can be achieved by attracting both extensive and intensive factors of production. Having an ambiguous agro-industrial complex, there is a serious differentiation of the food market sectors in terms of sufficiency, and on the other hand, there is a decrease in demand due to declining population real incomes. To assess the level of import substitution, a cluster analysis was carried out. The taxonomy of regional statistics divided the regions into two groups. Cluster no. 1 (moscow region, tatarstan, krasnodar and altai territories, bashkortostan, voronezh region, etc.) Demonstrates serious success in organizing the dairy industry from the perspective of import substitution, since its own production satisfies not only domestic needs, but also ensures the export flow. Cluster no. 2 (chelyabinsk, bryansk, omsk regions, udmurtia, the republic of dagestan, etc.) Is polar to cluster no. 1 in terms of technical and economic indicators characterizing the development of the dairy industry. To improve the sustainability of the industry and intensify the processes of import substitution, it is necessary to improve the system of state regulation. The set of necessary measures includes: physical and economic accessibility of loans, review of the regulatory framework in the field of modernization of the rural economy, stimulating the efficiency of agricultural production and using the green box tools (in particular, the food card program). Disciplinary: agricultural economics (dairy economics), management science. (C) 2020 int trans j eng manag sci tech.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. Assessment of the extent of the distribution and danger of activation of landslide processes in the republic of dagestan. Material and methods. The principal materials used were data of the government monitoring of subsoil conducted by hydrospetzgeologiya and its southern regional and territorial centres (dagestangeomonitoring) over the past fifteen years and published in the open press, as well as other literature sources. Maps were compiled using arcgis software. Results. An assessment was made of the extent of the distribution and danger of occurrence of landslide processes (for the period 2004-2018) in urban and rural settlements, on linear infrastructure (highways, oil, gas and water pipelines, power lines) and in reservoirs of large hydroelectric power stations of the republic. There was a high level of landslide activity recorded in 2004, 2005 and 2014, the lowest in 2007 and 2012. The largest number of landslide occurrences was recorded in the areas of makhachkala city (12.7\%) and tlyarotinskiy (9.6\%), dokuzparinskiy (8.1\%), buynakskiy (6.1\%), tsuntinskiy (5.4\%) and tsumadinskiy (5.0\%) districts. Landslides were most often activated in the summer period (41.6\%). 31.5\% of landslides occurred in spring, 22.6\% in autumn and 4.3\% in winter. Conclusion. Analysis of landslide activity in the territory of dagestan showed that the presence of favorable physico-geographical conditions for the development of landslide processes and active economic activity contribute to the wide distribution of landslides in the mountainous part of the republic.

ABSTRACT:
The article presents statistical data on the prevalence of infectious diseases of small cattle on the territory of the republic of dagestan, describes the epizootic situation for sheep and goats brucellosis, indicates the number of animals studied, as well as the number of disadvantaged areas and affected animals. To study the diagnostic value of the indirect hemagglutination reaction (ihr), in comparison with the rose bengal test (rbt) and other serological methods (agglutination reaction (ar), complement fixation test (cft), and idr with o-polysaccharide (ops) antigen), 496 ewes from a brucellosis-free farm and 589 heads from affected farms were examined. The rose-bengal test revealed brucellosis in 114 (20.4\%) ewes, second only to the indirect hemagglutination reaction. Studies have confirmed the specificity, high sensitivity and suitability of the rose-bengal test for the diagnosis of brucellosis in small cattle. (C) 2021 int trans j eng manag sci tech.

ABSTRACT:
The work is devoted to the estimation of microalgae resource potential for bio-oil production. We propose a method of climate and infrastructural factors spatial analysis for estimations of resource and the possibility of bio-oil production facilities construction in the study region. The resource potential depends on the area of the territory that can be used to produce biomass as feedstock for biofuel production, and equal to the amount of microalgae biomass that can be obtained on this territory. For the case study we selected the territory of the republic of dagestan (russia) and microalgae arthrospira platensis and dunaliella salina. As an infrastructural factors, which may reduce the cost of bio-oil production we considered the following sources of cheap material resources and energy: seawater (as a source of macro- and microelements), geothermal water (as low-temperature heat source), co2 emissions of cement plants and combined heat and power plants (as carbon source and to reduce co2 emission). The analyses of these factors using the technology of geoinformation systems allowed to find the most suitable territories for microalgae plant allocation and therefore estimate resource potential for bio-oil production with maximum profit.

ABSTRACT:
A recent study in 2019-2020 assessed the productivity, the quality of fatty and essential oils, and the mineral composition of eight nigella genotypes at the federal state budget scientific institution (fsbsi), research institute of agriculture of crimea, simferopol, russia. Of the eight genotypes, two cultivars originated from crimea, russia (nigella sativa cv. `krymchanka,' and nigella damascena cv. `yalita'), and one each from six european-asian countries, i.e., dagestan, uzbekistan, and sweden (nigella sativa), pakistan and india (nigella indica), and belgium (nigella damascena). The russian nigella genotypes served as control. Genotypes from three european-asian countries (sweden, pakistan, and dagestan) distinguished from the rest by their highest seed productivity, i.e., 1.0-1.6 g plant-1, which was 1.7-2.7 times higher than the control cultivar `krymchanka.' The seed productivity of the genotype n. Damascena cv. `yalita' control was 1.5 times greater than the nigella genotype from belgium. The n. Indica produced the highest fatty oil content (29.9\%), which exceeded two other species, i.e., n. Sativa and n. Damascena by 16\%-22\%. Fatty oils of nigella also contained essential oils of 0.5\% for n. Sativa and 1.2\% for n. Damascena. The essential oil of n. Sativa contained dominant components, such as, p-cymene (53.5\%) and thymoquinone (19.2\%), while n. Damascena contained p-cymol (82.2\%) and other principal components. The identified samples with the maximum accumulation of fatty and essential oils, and macro and microelements can be used to treat and replenish the deficient elements in the human body. Nigella genotype samples exhibited high accumulation of microelements, viz., potassium, calcium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, and molybdenum in the leaves and seeds.

ABSTRACT:
The present paper discusses the historical background of selected terms in the world of east caucasian languages that are related to the domain of metallurgy (copper, iron, tin, plumb, gold, and silver) augmented by terms for `coal' and `salt'. A closer inspection of these terms shows that none of them can be reconstructed for proto-east caucasian. Rather, we have to deal either with terms that have been coined in the intermediate protolanguages (nakh, avar-andian, tsezian, lezgian, lak, dargwa, and khinalug) or with more or less recent loans stemming mainly from the iranian and turkic languages. The absence of reconstructable terms for the items under review suggests that the speakers of the east caucasian proto-language had not been involved expressively in metallurgic traditions (as opposed to farming traditions). Tentatively, these speakers can thus be associated with the early farming culture within the complex of the kuro-araxes culture. Only after the proto-language disintegrated due to the migration of most of its speakers in the dagestan and the regions of chechnya, some societies related to these intermediate proto-languages must have been involved more expressively in metallurgic traditions. The more recent loans, e.g. For copper, gold, and silver, stemming from iranian (persian) and turkic (kumyk and azeri) illustrate a shift in conceptualising these objects: they were now interpreted as artifacts (rather than as natural resources) that were associated with the cultures of the dominant `oriental' societies. The paper can be seen as a preliminary study concerning the areal distribution of lexical patterns in the eastern caucasus from a historical perspective.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. To study the ecological and epidemiological features of the spread of toxoplasmosis in the territory of the republic of dagestan. Material and methods. A total of 3152 people in the 7-50 years age range living in makhachkala, kaspiysk, derbent and rural settlements of different climatic and geographical zones of the republic, were examined for toxoplasmosis. Among those surveyed were 1817 women and 82 children. Disease with toxoplasmosis was diagnosed according to laboratory and clinical and epidemiological data. Of the serological research methods, rif (immunofluorescence reaction) and elisa (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were used. Based on the survey results, ecological and epidemiological maps were complied results. It was revealed that the inhabitants of lowlands are 1,7 times more likely to be infected with toxoplasmosis than mountain settlements. The unequal frequency of toxoplasmosis infection in residents of mountainous and foothill areas depends not only on the altitude of the area above sea level, but also on soil moisture (plains and foothills), the intensity of isolation (highlands), as well as contact with infected domestic and agricultural animals. Infection with toxoplasma invasion in different territories varied within the range of 17.3\%-29.1\%. Conclusion. Identification of the sources of toxopiasma invasion was undertaken structured around regionally-oriented methods for the prevention of the disease. Typifying the sources of toxoplasmosis included monitoring: levels of sanitation when in contact with insufficiently thermally processed food products; obligatory hand washing after working with the soil; contact with pets; special sanitary and veterinary control over persons in contact with animals, as well as sanitary and medical care of patients and pregnant women.

ABSTRACT:
The relevance of the study of mycoses is increasing due to their widespread distribution. Field experiments were carried out on sites in the region with short daylight hours (dagestan) and long daylight hours (volgograd). Fungal diseases were investigated on crops with short daylight hours: cucumber, pepper, and cotton according to the methods generally accepted in phytopathology. The species composition of aboriginal and exotic infections was revealed. Each culture under conditions of long daylight hours is characterized by damage by 4-5 species of fungi. The manifestation of exotic infections is observed at the beginning of the growing season at the seedling stage. The role of the introduction of short-day plants to the northern regions in the spread of exotic species of pathogenic fungi is shown. The species composition of fungi on crops in the study areas was found to be identical. They belong to different biological groups, but saprotrophs, biotrophs and hemibiotrophs predominate. It was found that fusarium lolii (wm.g. Sm.) Sacc and rhizoctonia solani kuehn (on cotton) and verticillium dahliae kleb and rhizoctonia solani j.g. Moved to new areas together with seeds. Kuhn (on pepper). These species are capable of causing epiphytotics at the beginning of the growing season with a low natural infectious background. The accumulation of native species of infection in the lands adjacent to the fields during the cultivation period leads to the appearance of epiphytoties in the second half of the growing season. First of all, the assimilation apparatus, flowers, ovaries and fruits are affected.

ABSTRACT:
The intensification of pasture degradation in the southern part of european russia, which is caused by unfavorable hydrothermal conditions and unregulated livestock numbers, requires the development of approaches to assess the capacity of forage lands using earth remote sensing methods. The spectral reflectance properties of vegetation are determined by its taxonomic, structural, phenological, biophysical, and biochemical characteristics. However, the patterns of how these parameters affect the spectral response are region-specific and heavily influenced by soil cover. Therefore, it is essential to expand the regional scope of studies on the spectral reflectance properties of various vegetation types. This research is devoted to determining the spectral reflectance properties of natural zonal pastures in southern european russia, based on geobotanical investigations and field spectrometry using the psr-1100f instrument within the 320-1100 nm range. Groundwork was carried out in may (the period of maximum green mass of vegetation) 2020-2022 in the territories of natural zonal pastures in astrakhan and volgograd oblasts, stavropol krai, and the republics of dagestan and kalmykia. Significant differences were found between feather grasses, semishrubs, and annuals in the visible and near-ultraviolet spectral regions. Changes in the projective cover, under other equal conditions, have the most significant impact on spectral properties in the 660-670 nm range, which is consistent with the results of other researchers. Vegetation indices were identified that are best suited for determining projective cover and above-ground biomass of pastures with various dominant species. Further research will enable transitioning from point measurements of spectral reflectance and structural vegetation characteristics to satellite data with different spatial resolutions.
