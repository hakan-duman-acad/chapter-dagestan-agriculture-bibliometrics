ABSTRACT:
Aim genome-wide genetic data can provide key input for both taxonomy and conservation, but its use in this context remains limited. In this study, we performed the first genome-wide assessment of genetic variation in two populations of the eurasian lynx, the balkan population, the most threatened, and the caucasian population, a possible glacial refugium, with the aim to place them in the context of the species, investigate their demographic history and evaluate their genetic status. Location the balkans and the caucasus. Methods we obtained whole genome resequencing data from seven balkan and 12 caucasian lynx, and analysed them along with novel and existing data from other populations. Based on a total 105 whole genome and 114 mitogenome sequences, we reconstructed phylogenetic and historical relationships, ancient and recent demography, and patterns of genetic diversity and inbreeding. Results both the balkan and the caucasian lynx appear as distinct mitochondrial lineages that diverged from the rest of the eurasian lynx lineages ca. 92.6 kya, and from each other ca. 46.4 kya. Autosomal data suggest, however, that the balkan lynx is closely related with the carpathian population, and revealing alarmingly low genetic diversity and high inbreeding. In contrast, the caucasian lynx shows a longer history of relative isolation from the rest of lynx populations and high genetic diversity, consistent with its large long-term effective population size. Main conclusions the taxonomic status of the balkan lynx remains unresolved due to the evidence of long-term isolation in the mitogenome, contrasting with extensive autosomal admixture and intense recent genetic drift in the nuclear genome. Our results alert on genetic risks and call for the consideration of genetic rescue from closely related carpathian lynxes. In contrast, substantial mitogenomic and autosomal divergence with no signs of genetic drift supports the identification of the caucasian lynx as a separate subspecies with good genetic health.

ABSTRACT:
For the first time, the analysis of polymorphism of complete mitochondrial genomes was performed in three dagestan local goat populations (n = 37), which were characterized by high genetic and haplotype diversity. We found that 90.88\% of the total genetic variability was due to intragroup differences and 4.86\% was due to intergroup differences. For the studied sample of goats, significant negative values of the tajima's d and fu's fs neutrality indices were calculated (p < 0.05). We performed a phylogenetic analysis using the nucleotide sequences of domestic goats and bezoars belonging to different haplogroups. Our study revealed that all studied samples of dagestan local goats belonged to haplogroup a, which is the most frequent one in domestic goats.

ABSTRACT:
Simple summary russia has diverse specifically selected and multipurpose goat resources. However, the origin of the local goats is still enigmatic. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed mitochondrial dna (mtdna) fragments of seven russian local goat populations to provide the first insight into their maternal lineage. The territory of modern russia lies on the crossroads of east and west and covers various geographical environments where diverse groups of local goats originated. In this work, we present the first study on the maternal origin of russian local goats, including altai mountain (n= 9), dagestan downy (n= 18), dagestan local (n= 12), dagestan milk (n= 15), karachaev (n= 21), orenburg (n= 10), and soviet mohair (n= 7) breeds, based on 715 bp d-loop mitochondrial dna (mtdna) sequences. Saanen goats (n= 5) were used for comparison. Our findings reveal a high haplotype (hd = 0.843-1.000) and nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.0112-0.0261). A total of 59 haplotypes were determined in the russian goat breeds, in which all differed from the haplotypes of the saanen goats. The haplotypes identified in altai mountain, orenburg, soviet mohair, and saanen goats were breed specific. Most haplotypes (56 of 59) were clustered together with samples belonging to haplogroup a, which was in accordance with the global genetic pattern of maternal origin seen in most goats worldwide. The haplotypes that were grouped together with rare haplogroups d and g were found in the altai mountain breed and haplogroup c was detected in the soviet mohair breed. Thus, our findings revealed that local goats might have been brought to russia via various migration routes. In addition, haplotype sharing was found in aboriginal goat populations from overlapping regions, which might be useful information for their official recognition status.

ABSTRACT:
Krascheninnikovia ceratoides (chenopodiaceae) is a steppe and semi-desert plant with two subspecies, k. Ceratoides subsp. Ceratoides, which is widespread in eurasia, and k. Ceratoides subsp. Lanata, which grows in western and central north america. A few disjunct populations of k. Ceratoides subsp. Ceratoides are found in anatolia, europe and north africa to the west of its otherwise continuous eurasian distribution. To understand the evolutionary history of this characteristic steppe and semi-desert plant, we analysed its phylogeny and biogeography. We sequenced several loci including its, ets and the chloroplast intergenic spacer regions atpb-rbcl, rpl32-tra and trnl-trnf to establish a time-calibrated phylogeny and reconstruct intraspecific relationships. Furthermore, we identified the ploidy level of individuals. While diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid individuals have been reported in the literature, we were only able to find diploids and tetraploids. The diploids were found in the east of mongolia, kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, russia and the usa. The tetraploids were located in the west of mongolia, kazakhstan, tajikistan, russia, and europe. Populations were uniformly di- or tetraploid. Our results indicate that the species may have spread from the area of mongolia, northern china and middle asia (i.e., the altai mountains region) in two opposite directions - on the one hand, diploids migrated to the east, to eastern asia and north america, and on the other hand diploids and tetraploids migrated to the west, to western asia and europe. Fossil-calibrated gene trees were used to estimate the age of the species. Diversification within the species is probably of pleistocene age. Our dated analysis indicates that the first split among extant lineages of the species took place in the early pleistocene (gelasian). The spread of the main lineages is likely related to major phases of steppe and semi-desert expansions during glacial periods of the pleistocene.

ABSTRACT:
Local adaptations to the environment are an important aspect of the diversity of a species and their discovery, description and quantification has important implications for the fields of taxonomy, evolutionary and conservation biology. In this study, we scan genomes from several populations across the distributional range of the eurasian lynx, with the objective of finding genomic windows under positive selection which may underlie local adaptations to different environments. A total of 394 genomic windows are found to be associated to local environmental conditions, and they are enriched for genes involved in metabolism, behaviour, synaptic organization and neural development. Adaptive genetic structure, reconstructed from snps in candidate windows, is considerably different than the neutral genetic structure of the species. A widespread adaptively homogeneous group is recovered occupying areas of harsher snow and temperature climatic conditions in the north-western, central and eastern parts of the distribution. Adaptively divergent populations are recovered in the westernmost part of the range, especially within the baltic population, but also predicted for different patches in the western and southern part of the range, associated with different snow and temperature regimes. Adaptive differentiation driven by climate does not correlate much with the subspecies taxonomic delimitations, suggesting that subspecific divergences are mostly driven by neutral processes of genetic drift and gene flow. Our results will aid the selection of source populations for assisted gene flow or genetic rescue programs by identifying what climatic patterns to look for as predictors of pre-adaptation of individuals. Particularly, the carpathian population is confirmed as the best source of individuals for the genetic rescue of the endangered, isolated and genetically eroded balkan population. Additionally, reintroductions in central and western europe, currently based mostly on carpathian lynxes, could consider the baltic population as an additional source to increase adaptive variation and likely improve adaptation to their milder climate.

ABSTRACT:
The phylogeography of the european wild boar was mainly determined by postglacial recolonization patterns from mediterranean refugia after the last ice age. Here we present the first analysis of snp polymorphism within the complete mtdna genome of west russian (n = 8), european (n = 64), and north african (n = 5) wild boar. Our analyses provided evidence of unique lineages in the east-caucasian (dagestan) region and in central italy. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that these lineages are basal to the other european mtdna sequences. We also show close connection between the western siberian and eastern european populations. Also, the north african samples were clustered with the iberian population. Phylogenetic trees and migration modeling revealed a high proximity of dagestan sequences to those of central italy and suggested possible gene flow between western asia and southern europe which was not directly related to northern and central european lineages. Our results support the presence of old maternal lineages in two southern glacial refugia (i.e., caucasus and the italian peninsula), as a legacy of an ancient wave of colonization of southern europe from an eastern origin.

ABSTRACT:
Soil sinorhizobium phage ap-16-3, a strain phylogenetically close to rhizobium phage 16-3, was isolated in a mountainous region of dagestan, belonging to the origin of cultivated plants in the caucasus, according to vavilov n.i. The genome of phage ap-16-3 is 61 kbp in size and contains 62 orfs, of which 42 orfs have homologues in the genome of rhizobium phage 16-3, which was studied in the 1960s-1980s. A search for rhizobium phage 16-3-related sequences was performed in the genomes of modern strains of root nodule bacteria belonging to different species, genera, and families. A total of 43 prophages of interest were identified out of 437 prophages found in the genomes of 42 strains, of which 31 belonged to sinorhizobium meliloti species. However, almost all of the mentioned prophages contained single orfs, and only two prophages contained 51 and 39 orfs homologous to phages related to 16-3. These prophages were detected in s. Meliloti nv1.1.1 and rh. Leguminosarum oyalib strains belonging to different genera; however, the similarity level of these two prophages did not exceed 14.7\%. Analysis of the orphan genes in these prophages showed that they encoded predominantly virion structural elements, but also enzymes and an extensive group of hypothetical proteins belonging to the l, s, and e regions of viral genes of phage 16-3. The data obtained indicate that temperate phages related to 16-3 had high infectivity against nodule bacteria and participated in intragenomic recombination events involving other phages, and in horizontal gene transfer between rhizobia of different genera. According to the data obtained, it is assumed that the repetitive lysogenic cycle of temperate bacteriophages promotes the dissolution of the phage genetic material in the host bacterial genome, and radical updating of phage and host bacterial genomes takes place.

ABSTRACT:
Caucasian tur (capra caucasica) is native to greater caucasus mountain chain from azerbaijan and georgia in the east to krasnodar region of russia in the west. This species is divided into two subspecies (by some authors into species)-east-caucasian tur and west-caucasian tur and a subpopulation referred to as mid-caucasian tur. Up to date most of the genetic studies of caucasian tur are based on mitochondrial dna sequences and comprehensive investigation based on nuclear dna is required for clarification of its genetic diversity and population structure. In our work, we assessed the applicability of illumina goat snp50 beadchip for genetic studies of caucasian tur. Total of 15 specimens of capra caucasica including east-caucasian tur from dagestan (e\_tur, n = 5), west-caucasian tur from karachay-cherkessia (w\_tur, n = 5), and mid-caucasian tur from kabardino-balkaria (m\_tur, n = 5) were genotyped. After quality control, 5544 polymorphic loci, which were distributed all over 29 autosomes, were detected. The lowest number of snps was found on the 25th chromosome-68, and the highest on the 1st chromosome-348. It was shown that all the three groups of caucasian tur clustered separately. A total of 2061 snps were common for all the populations, 594 were found only in w\_tur, 689 in e\_tur, and 530 in m\_tur. Individual heterozygosity ranged from 0.273 to 0.282 in w\_tur, from 0.217 to 0.253 in e\_tur, and from 0.255 to 0.283 in m\_tur. A clinal pattern of genetic variation was revealed. It was suggested to consider caucasian tur a single species with several ecotypes. Thus, in our study we demonstrated that the illumina goat snp50 beadchip developed for domestic goats can be used as a useful tool for genetic studies of caucasian tur.

ABSTRACT:
The dagestan mountain (dm) cattle breed was established to provide cheese and milk products to mountain dwellers in the specific conditions of the republic of dagestan in southern russia. Only 650 head of dm cattle were registered in 2020, and their ``breed purity'' is questionable. We aimed to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of modern dm cattle using short tandem repeat (str) markers. The sample included 150 animals collected from private owners in dagestan during a scientific expedition (n = 32) and provided by a gene pool farm (n = 118). An additional 166 samples from other cattle breeds distributed in the breeding zone of dm cattle were used as the comparison groups. The genotypes for the 11 str loci recommended by isag were obtained using a genetic analyzer. We identified a high level of genetic diversity as revealed by allelic richness calculations (ar = 6.82 vs. 4.38-5.82 in other cattle breeds) and observed heterozygosity indices (uhe = 0.76 vs. 0.65-0.72). Based on the structure results, animals with low levels of admixture with other breeds were found within the dm cattle, which can be considered as candidates for use in germplasm conservation programs.

ABSTRACT:
In recent years many cases of hybridization and introgression became known for chelonians, requiring a better understanding of their speciation mechanisms. Phylogeographic investigations offer basic data for this challenge. We use the sister species mauremys caspica and m. Rivulata, the most abundant terrapins in the near and middle east and south-east europe, as model. Their phylogeographies provide evidence that speciation of chelonians fits the allopatric speciation model, with both species being in the parapatric phase of speciation, and that intrinsic isolation mechanisms are developed during speciation. Hybridization between m. Caspica and m. Rivulata is very rare, suggesting that the increasing numbers of hybrids in other species are caused by human impact on environment (breakdown of ecological isolation). Genetic differentiation within m. Caspica and m. Rivulata resembles the paradigm of southern genetic richness and northern purity of european biota. However, in west asia this pattern is likely to reflect dispersal and vicariance events older than the holocene. For m. Caspica three distinct pleistocene refuges are postulated (central anatolia, south coast of caspian sea, gulf of persia). Morphologically defined subspecies within m. Caspica are not supported by genetic data. This is one of the few studies available about the phylogeography of west and central asian species.

ABSTRACT:
Tortoises of the testudo graeca complex inhabit a patchy range that covers part of three continents (africa, europe, asia). It extends approximately 6500 kin in an east-west direction from eastern iran to the moroccan atlantic coast and about 1600 km in a north-south direction from the danube delta to the libyan cyrenaica peninsula. Recent years have seen a rapid increase of recognized taxa. Based on morphological investigations, it was suggested that this group consists of as many as 20 distinct species and is paraphyletic with respect to t. Kleinmanni sensu lato and t marginata. Based on samples from representative localities of the entire range, we sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and conducted nuclear genomic fingerprinting with issr pcr. The t graeca complex is monophyletic and sister to a taxon consisting of t kleinmanni sensu lato and t marginata. The t graeca complex comprises six well-supported mtdna clades (a-f). Highest diversity is found in the caucasian region, where four clades occur in close neighbourhood. This suggests, in agreement with the fossil record, the caucasian region as a radiation centre. Clade a corresponds to haplotypes from the east caucasus. It is the sister group of another clade (b) from north africa and western mediterranean islands. Clade c includes haplotypes from western asia minor, the southeastern balkans and the western and central caucasus region. Its sister group is a fourth, widely distributed clade (d) from southern and eastern asia minor and the levantine region (near east). Two further clades are distributed in iran (e, northwestern and central iran; f, eastern iran). Distinctness of these six clades and sister group relationships of (a + b) and (c + d) are well-supported; however, the phylogeny of the resulting four clades (a + b), (c + d), e and f is poorly resolved. While in a previous study (fritz et a]., 2005a) all traditionally recognized testudo species were highly distinct using mtdna sequences and issr fingerprints, we detected within the t graeca complex no nuclear genomic differentiation paralleling mtdna clades. We conclude that all studied populations of the t graeca complex are conspecific under the biological species concept. There is major incongruence between mtdna clades and morphologically defined taxa. Morphologically well-defined taxa, like t g. Armeniaca or t g. Floweri, nest within clades comprising also geographically neighbouring, but morphologically distinctive populations of other taxa (clade a: t g. Armeniaca, t g. Ibera, t g. Pallasi; clade d: t g. Anamurensis, t g. Antakyensis, t g. Floweri, t g. Ibera, t g. Terrestris), while sequences of morphologically similar tortoises of the same subspecies (t g. Ibera sensu stricto or t g. Ibera sensu lato) scatter over two or three genetically distinct clades (a, c or a, c, d, respectively). This implies that pronounced morphological plasticity, resulting in phenotypes shaped by environmental pressure, masks genetic differentiation. To achieve a more realistic taxonomic arrangement reflecting mtdna clades, we propose reducing the number of t graeca subspecies considerably and regard in the eastern part of the range five subspecies as valid (t g. Armeniaca, t g. Buxtoni, t g. Ibera, t g. Terrestris, t g. Zarudnyi). As not all north african taxa were included in the present study, we refrain from synonymizing north african taxa with t g. Graeca (mtdna clade b) that represents a further valid subspecies.

ABSTRACT:
Gibberellin-insensitive reduced height genes are widely spread in modern wheat varieties, making them resistant to lodging under conditions of intensive farming. However, the limited diversity of these genes present in wheat germplasm can limit the adaptability of newly created cultivars to the changing climate. The diversity of the gibberellin signaling pathway genes involved in plant height control-reduced height 1 (rht-d1), gibberellin-insensitive dwarf 1 (gid1-d) and gibberellin-insensitive dwarf 2 (gid2-d)-was studied in the diploid wild goatgrass aegilops tauschii coss., one of the ancestral species of the bread wheat (triticum aestivum l.) And the donor of its d subgenome, using high-throughput sequencing. The examination of 24 ae. Tauschii accessions of different geographical origins revealed a large number of new alleles (haplotypes) not found in bread wheat varieties. Some of the detected polymorphisms lead to changes in the amino acid sequence of proteins. Four isoforms (amino acid sequence variants) were found for the rht-d1 protein, and two isoforms-for the gid1 and gid2 proteins, each. An analysis of the co-occurrence frequencies of various isoforms of the three proteins showed that their combinations were not random in ae. Tauschii, which may indicate the functional significance of their differences. New alleles of the rht-d1, gid1-d, and gid2-d genes are promising for introgression into bread wheat and studying their effect on plant height and adaptability.

ABSTRACT:
Twenty-two rhizobia strains isolated from three distinct populations (north ossetia, dagestan, and armenia) of a relict legume vavilovia formosa were analysed to determine their position within rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae (rlv). These bacteria are described as symbionts of four plant genera pisum, vicia, lathyrus, and lens from the fabeae tribe, of which vavilovia is considered to be closest to its last common ancestor (lca). In contrast to biovar viciae, bacteria from rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii (rh) inoculate plants from the trifolieae tribe. Comparison of house-keeping (hkg: 16s rrna, glnii, glt a, and dnak) and symbiotic (sym: noda, nodc, nodd, and nifh) genes of the symbionts of v. Formosa with those of other rlv and rlt strains reveals a significant group separation, which was most pronounced for sym genes. A remarkable feature of the strains isolated from v. Formosa was the presence of the nodx gene, which was commonly found in rlv strains isolated from afghanistan pea genotypes. Tube testing of different strains on nine plant species, including all genera from the fabeae tribe, demonstrated that the strains from v. Formosa nodulated the same cross inoculation group as the other rlv strains. Comparison of nucleotide similarity in sym genes suggested that their diversification within sym-biotypes of rlv was elicited by host plants. Contrariwise, that of hkg genes could be caused by either local adaptation to soil niches or by genetic drift. Long-term ecological isolation, genetic separation, and the ancestral position of v. Formosa suggested that symbionts of v. Formosa could be responsible for preserving ancestral genotypes of the rlv biovar.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. The work is aimed at exploring the molecular and genetic properties of avian paramyxovirus 4 (apmv-4) isolated from the mallard duck. Material and methods. In 2018, as a part of an influenza a virus surveillance programme, biological samples were collected from wild birds on lake adzhi (papas) in the republic of dagestan. The isolation of virus strains from biological samples was performed using 10-day-old special pathogen free chicken eggs. The primary detection of hemagglutinating agents in the fluid of the allantoic cavity was carried out via hemagglutination assay. The presence of rna of the influenza a virus was determined using real time pcr. Then, for samples negative in pcr for the influenza a virus, the complete genome dna sequences were established using ngs sequencing. It was determined that the apmv-4 strain obtained belonged to intraspecific genetic lines was determined using phylogenetic analysis. Results. Apmv 4 strain was isolated for the first time in the western caspian region. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome and gene f showed that the apmv-4/mallard/dagestan/52d/2018 strain belongs to the eurasian glade of subgenotypes. Analysis of amino add substitutions showed that the cleavage site of the fusion protein is monobasic which is characteristic of lentogenic strains. Conclusion. During the surveillance program for influenza a viruses in autumn 2018, the apmv 4 strain was isolated from the mallard duck. Analysis revealed that the apmv-4 strain was closely phylogenetically related to strains isolated from two wild and one domestic duck from china. This suggests an interconnection between the bird populations in china and the western caspian region within the west asian-east african migration route.

ABSTRACT:
Research into the phylogenetic relationships of lumpy skin disease virus (lsdv) strains was long overlooked, partially due to its original restricted distribution to sub-saharan africa. However, recent incursions into northern latitudes, and a rapid spread causing major economic losses worldwide, have intensified additional research on the disease and the causative virus. This study delineates the phylogeny of lsdv in the context of full genome sequences of strains recovered in the field, as well as strains highly passaged in cell culture. We sequenced the oldest known field strain to date (isolate lsdv/haden/rsa/1954 [south africa] recovered from an outbreak in 1954), a recent field isolate (lsdv/280-kzn/rsa/2018 [south africa] sequenced directly from blood during an outbreak in 2018) and strain lsdv/russia/dagestan-75 (a high-passaged cell culture strain derived from the field strain, lsdv/russia/dagestan/2015 [russia]). Sequence analysis placed the field strain lsdv/haden/rsa/1954 in the same cluster (cluster 1.1) with attenuated neethling-type commercial vaccine viruses, with eight snp differences, discrediting the previously held hypothesis that cluster 1.1 vaccine strains were derived from cluster 1.2 field viruses via the process of attenuation between them. In contrast, the recent lsdv/280-kzn/rsa/2018 isolate grouped with other recent field isolates in cluster 1.2, providing evidence that cluster 1.1 strains were displaced by cluster 1.2 strains in south africa. Based on the field isolates between 1954 and 2018, the substitution rate of 7.4 x 10(-6) substitutions/site/year was established, with mutations occurring in either synonymous sites or intergenic regions. This is the first evolutionary metric recorded for lsdv. Comparing the genome sequences of high-passage strains of lsdv showed that propagation in vitro without animal host selective pressure generates mainly non-synonymous snps in virus-replication genes. These results improve our understanding of lsdv evolution and demonstrate that the population dynamics of circulating isolates is not constant, with lsdv associated with different genetic clusters dominating the landscape during specific periods in time.

ABSTRACT:
Wild waterfowl birds are known to be the main reservoir for a variety of avian influenza viruses of different subtypes. Some subtypes, such as h2nx, h8nx, h12nx, and h14nx, occur relatively rarely in nature. During 10-year long-term surveillance, we isolated five rare h12n5 and one h12n2 viruses in three different distinct geographic regions of northern eurasia and studied their characteristics. H12n2 from the far east region was a double reassortant containing hemagglutinin (ha), non-structural (ns) and nucleoprotein (np) segments of the american lineage and others from the classical eurasian avian-like lineage. H12n5 viruses contain eurasian lineage segments. We suggest a phylogeographical scheme for reassortment events associated with geographical groups of aquatic birds and their migration flyways. The h12n2 virus is of particular interest as this subtype has been found in common teal in the russian far east region, and it has a strong relation to north american avian influenza virus lineages, clearly showing that viral exchange of segments between the two continents does occur. Our results emphasize the importance of avian influenza virus (aiv) surveillance in northern eurasia for the annual screening of virus characteristics, including the genetic constellation of rare virus subtypes, to understand the evolutionary ecology of aiv.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. The work was to compile a list of bird species and their status in the forest-steppe and steppe of the middle irtysh region at the present time and to analyse their potential ability in terms of the transmission of influenza viruses that pose a danger to humans and farm animals.materials and methods. The study of avifauna and their status in the forest-steppe and steppe of the middle irtysh region has been conducted by us from 1973 to the present. The analysis of literary sources has been carried out since the time of p.s. Pallas's travels in the region in 1871. In addition, information on the wetlands of the irtysh region which is freely available on the internet was used.results. At the beginning of the 20th century, about 200 species of birds were recorded in the vicinity of omsk, 125 of them being breeding species. At present about 150 species of birds have been recorded in omsk and its environs. Of the 290 bird species of the middle irtysh region, 48 species (16.6\%) belong among the natural hosts of influenza a viruses. Of these, at least 40 species are migratory and 25 species nest there. In addition to the prinicipal influenza virus host species, the list of birds of the middle irtysh region includes several species of scavengers and predators, as well as synanthropic bird species. These species may share habitat or food resources with the main host species of influenza viruses. Influenza a viruses can be transmitted between species either by direct or indirect contact through mechanical propagation or contamination of nutritional resources.conclusion. As the 3 largest bird migratory flyways run through the middle irtysh region where there is a significant number of wetlands, the prerequisites are created for a mass simultaneous accumulation of different populations and species of migratory birds carrying viruses and, accordingly, a high probability of exchanging viral genomes with each other and their further spread to new regions.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. The aim is to explore the molecular and biological characteristics of influenza virus subtype h6n8. Material and methods. Regular collecting of biological samples from wild birds was carried out in 2016 in the south of western siberia. Isolation of avian influenza virus strains from birds' cloacal swabs was performed using three passages in embryonated chicken eggs. Hemagglutination assay was used to detect viruses in the allantoic fluid. Type and subtype of influenza viruses were identified using reverse transcription pcr (rt-pcr). Results. This is the first time the avian influenza virus h6n8 subtype has been isolated in russia. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that hemagglutinin (ha) and neuraminidase (na) segments of a/gadwall/chany/97/2016(h6n8) strain genome belonged to the eurasian lineages of avian influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the ha sequence of the strain was closely related to the strain isolated from a duck in bangladesh in 2015 (a/duck/bangladesh/25767/2015(h6n1). Conclusion. Avian influenza viruses subtype h6n8 have the ability to circulate among wild waterfowl and poultry, increasing the chance of reassortment and transmission of h6 virus strains among birds. For this reason, it is of crucial importance to strengthen surveillance for avian influenza h6 subtype among wild birds in the south of western siberia.

ABSTRACT:
The radiation of palearctic green toads (bufotes) holds great potential to evaluate the role of hybridization in phylogeography at multiple stages along the speciation continuum. With fifteen species representing three ploidy levels, this model system is particularly attractive to examine the causes and consequences of allopoly-ploidization, a prevalent yet enigmatic pathway towards hybrid speciation. Despite substantial efforts, the evolutionary history of this species complex remains largely blurred by the lack of consistency among the corresponding literature. To get a fresh, comprehensive view on bufotes phylogeography, here we combined genome-wide multilocus analyses (rad-seq) with an extensive compilation of mitochondrial, genome size, niche modelling, distribution and phenotypic (bioacoustics, morphometrics, toxin composition) datasets, representing hundreds of populations throughout eurasia. We provide a fully resolved nuclear phylogeny for bufotes and highlight exceptional cyto-nuclear discordances characteristic of complete mtdna replacement (in 20\% of species), mitochondrial surfing during post-glacial expansions, and the formation of homoploid hybrid populations. Moreover, we traced the origin of several allopolyploids down to species level, showing that all were exclusively fathered by the west himalayan b. Latastii but mothered by several diploid forms inhabiting central asian lowlands, an asymmetry consistent with hypotheses on mate choice and dobzhansky-muller incompatibilities. Their intermediate call phenotypes potentially allowed for rapid reproductive isolation, while toxin compositions converged towards the ecologically-closest parent. Across the radiation, we pinpoint a stepwise progression of reproductive isolation through time, with a threshold below which hybridizability is irrespective of divergence (< 6my), above which species barely admix and eventually evolve different mating calls (6-10my), or can successfully cross-breed through allopolyploidization (> 15my). Finally, we clarified the taxonomy of bufotes (including genetic analyses of type series) and formally described two new species, b. Cypriensis sp. Nov. (Endemic to cyprus) and b. Perrini sp. Nov. (Endemic to central asia). Embracing the genomic age, our framework marks the advent of a new exciting era for evolutionary research in these iconic amphibians.

ABSTRACT:
Cryptic phylogeographic diversifications provide unique models to examine the role of phylogenetic divergence on the evolution of reproductive isolation, without extrinsic factors such as ecological and behavioural differentiation. Yet, to date very few comparative studies have been attempted within such radiations. Here, we characterize a new speciation continuum in a group of widespread eurasian amphibians, the pelobates spadefoot toads, by conducting multilocus (restriction site associated dna sequencing and mitochondrial dna) phylogenetic, phylogeographic and hybrid zone analyses. Within the p. Syriacus complex, we discovered species-level cryptic divergences (>5 million years ago [my]) between populations distributed in the near-east (hereafter p. Syriacus sensu stricto [s.s.]) And southeastern europe (hereafter p. Balcanicus), each featuring deep intraspecific lineages. Altogether, we could scale hybridizability to divergence time along six different stages, spanning from sympatry without gene flow (p. Fuscus and p. Balcanicus, >10 my), parapatry with highly restricted hybridization (p. Balcanicus and p. Syriacus s.s., >5 my), narrow hybrid zones (\~15 km) consistent with partial reproductive isolation (p. Fuscus and p. Vespertinus, \~3 my), to extensive admixture between pleistocene and refugial lineages (<= 2 my). This full spectrum empirically supports a gradual build up of reproductive barriers through time, reversible up until a threshold that we estimate at \~3 my. Hence, cryptic phylogeographic lineages may fade away or become reproductively isolated species simply depending on the time they persist in allopatry, and without definite ecomorphological divergence.

ABSTRACT:
Latitudinal variations in species niche due to factors such as phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation pose fundamental problems for ecological niche modelling at large geographic scales. Species adaptation to varying climates across latitudes thus necessitates the latitudinal adjustment of climatic variables for incorporation into more accurate models of habitat suitability and species distribution. Previous studies have identified changes in species' elevational distributions across latitudes, however few studies incorporate latitude-adjusted variables into suitability or distribution models. In this study, we utilized generalized additive models (gams) to adjust bioclimatic variables by latitude in order to remove latitudinal variation in ecological niche models. We incorporated these latitude-adjusted variables into maximum entropy (maxent) models of two species of toad, bufo sachalinensis (previously bufo gargarizans) and bufo stejnegeri, in northeast asia. We additionally identified thresholds in bioclimatic and terrain variables that delineate boundaries between the two bufo species where their ranges overlap. We found that gam adjustment of bioclimatic variables effectively removed latitudinal variation in said variables. Maxent models incorporating these latitude-adjusted variables had significantly improved model fit (auc and tss) for both bufo species. We identified a potential sympatric area shared by the two species and delineated a geographic boundary thresholding the probable presence of one species over the other. This study shows a clear improvement for distribution models with the inclusion of latitude-adjusted bioclimatic variables for both narrow and wide-ranging species. This has implications for future distribution modelling practices, especially for geographically widespread species, and has potential for modelling species distributions in climate change scenarios. Further, the methodology for delimiting species thresholds has future use in modelling contact zones of related species.

ABSTRACT:
We studied the relationship between the variability and contemporary distribution of pelage phenotypes in one of most widely distributed felid species and an array of environmental and demographic conditions. We collected 672 photographic georeferenced records of the eurasian lynx throughout eurasia. We assigned each lynx coat to one of five phenotypes. Then we fitted the coat patterns to different environmental and anthropogenic variables, as well as the effective geographic distances from inferred glacial refugia. A majority of lynx were either of the large spotted (41.5\%) or unspotted (uniform, 36.2\%) phenotype. The remaining patterns (rosettes, small spots and pseudo-rosettes) were represented in 11.0\%, 7.4\%, and 3.9\% of samples, respectively. Although various environmental variables greatly affected lynx distribution and habitat suitability, it was the effect of least-cost distances from locations of the inferred refugia during the last glacial maximum that explained the distribution of lynx coat patterns the best. Whereas the occurrence of lynx phenotypes with large spots was explained by the proximity to refugia located in the caucasus/middle east, the uniform phenotype was associated with refugia in the far east and central asia. Despite the widely accepted hypothesis of adaptive functionality of coat patterns in mammals and exceptionally high phenotypic polymorphism in eurasian lynx, we did not find well-defined signs of habitat matching in the coat pattern of this species. Instead, we showed how the global patterns of morphological variability in this large mammal and its environmental adaptations may have been shaped by past climatic change.

ABSTRACT:
This study is based on the material of darkling beetles (tenebrionidae) collected from different localities of turkey between 1966 and 2020 and deposited in biodiversity science museum, atat??Rk university (erzurum, turkey). In total, 80 species and subspecies of the family tenebrionidae were listed. The following five species are recorded for turkey for the first ropatroides hirtulus (baudi di selve, 1876). In addition, new localities have been indicated for many species and subspecies, which have already been reported from turkey. The new synonymy is proposed: blaps tibialis reiche \& saulcy, 1857 = blaps ecaudata seidlitz, 1893, syn. Nov. The invasive population of the mediterranean species euboeus mimonti boieldieu, 1865 was found in erzurum but the species has not naturalised in eastern anatolia.

ABSTRACT:
Species of the genus helopelius reitter, 1922 (type species: stenomax aeneipennis allard, 1876) were known from rhodes and north africa. We found that two species described from rhodes belong to the genus stenohelops reitter, 1922, and helopelius can be interpreted as a subgenus within latter, guided by the article 23.2 of iczn. The following synonyms are proposed: helopelius, stat. N. (From genus to subgenus) = stenomaleis espanol, 1957, syn. N.; Stenohelops reitter, 1922 = gunarellus reitter, 1922, syn. N.; Stenohelops (helopelius) aeneipennis (allard, 1876) = helopelius disgregus reitter, 1922, syn. N., = gunarus gayirbegi nabozhenko \& keskin, 2009, syn. N. As a result, the following species are transferred from the former genus helopelius to the genus stenohelops: stenohelops (helopelius) nodifer (kraatz, 1880), comb. N.; Stenohelops (helopelius) otini (antoine, 1949), comb. N.; Stenohelops (helopelius) subsinuatus (antoine, 1951), comb. N.; Stenohelops (helopelius) verrucosus (vauloger de beaupre, 1900), comb. N.; Stenohelops (helopelius) zaianus (antoine, 1949), comb. N. Thus, the subgenus helopelius contains 11 species from three isolated geographical exclaves: western mediterranean, eastern mediterranean and china lectotypes of stenomax aeneipennis allard, 1876, helops gratus j. Frivaldszky, 1894 and cylindrinotus (helopelius) disgregus reitter, 1922 are designated. Data on fossil species of the genus and the allied extinct taxa, as well as on bionomics of extant species of the subgenus helopelius are presented. The check-list for extant and extinct species of stenohelops is given.

ABSTRACT:
Years of research of the subtribe blaptina made it possible to clarify relations between some species and propose changes in supraspecific structure of this subtribe. Blaps scabiosa baudi di selve, 1874 is designated as a type species of caraboblaps bauer, 1921, the new synonymy is proposed: blaps fabricius, 1775 = caraboblaps bauer, 1921, syn. N. Blaps nitens nitens laporte, 1840 is designated as a type species of periblaps bauer, 1921, blaps ominosa menetries, 1832 is designated as a type species of holoblaps bauer, 1921; type species of periblaps and holoblaps are transferred here to genus lithoblaps, as a result the following new synonymy is proposed: lithoblaps motschulsky, 1860 = periblaps bauer, 1921, syn. N. = holoblaps bauer, 1921, syn. N. The similarity of the structure of the aedeagus of ablapsis compressipes reitter, 1887 and some species of the subgenus prosoblapsia skopin et kaszab, 1978 (genus blaps fabricius, 1775) gives a base to transfer the taxon ablapsis reitter, 1887 into the genus blaps as a separate subgenus (ablapsis stat. Resurr.). Blaps tentyrioides seidlitz, 1893 (= blaps socia seidlitz, 1893) is designated as a type species of the subgenus protoblaps bauer, 1921. As the genera protoblaps bauer, 1921 and genoblaps bauer, 1921 have one type species and the aedeagal structure of type species of ablapsis, protoblaps and prosoblapsia is similar, the new synonymy is proposed: ablapsis reitter, 1887 = protoblaps bauer, 1921 syn. N. = genoblaps bauer, 1921 syn. N. = prosoblapsia skopin et kaszab, 1978, syn. N. Analysis of imaginal and larval structures of the species here united in the taxon lithoblaps motschulsky, 1860 and other members of blaps showed that differences between these two groups are comparable with those between other genera of the subtribe and, therefore, the former taxon is here regarded as a distinct genus lithoblaps gen. Resurr. Thus, 100 species and subspecies (marked as comb. N. Or comb. Resurr.) Are transferred from blaps to lithoblaps. The additional new combination is established: dila platythorax (gemminger, 1870), comb. N. (From blaps). The key to genera and the catalogue of the subtribe blaptina are given.

(S. Str.) Acutipenis sp. Nov. From gansu and ningxia, p. (S. Str.) Densipunctata sp. Nov. From gansu, and p. (S. Str.) Helanensis sp. Nov. From inner mongolia and ningxia. A synonymy between p. (S. Str.) Brevis baudi di selve, 1876 and p. Ballioni reitter, 1889 is proposed based on the examination of type and additional specimens. Lectotypes are designated for p. Hauseri reitter, 1899, p. Gebieni schuster, 1915, p. (S. Str.) Angusticollis kaszab, 1940, p. (S. Str.) Licenti kaszab, 1940, p. (S. Str.) Platytarsis kaszab, 1940 and p. (S. Str.) Suiyuana kaszab, 1940. Furthermore, new distribution records, images of adults and male aedeagus, and a key to chinese species are presented.

ABSTRACT:
A taxonomic review of tenebrionid platyopoid genera of the subfamily pimeliinae from eastern europe, central asia, afghanistan, iran and pakistan is given. This group of taxa was known before 1994 as the tribe platyopini motschulsky, 1849, which is now interpreted as a junior synonym of pimeliini latreille, 1802. The group is different from other pimeliini in having dorso-lateral eyes, located above the level of the genae, and it includes the following ultrapsammophilic genera at least from central and southern asia: apatopsis semenov, 1891, habrochiton semenov-tjan-shansky, 1907, habrobates semenov, 1903 [= kawiria schuster, 1935 syn. Nov.], dietomorpha reymond, 1938, przewalskia semenov, 1893, mantichorula reitter, 1889, platyope fischer von waldheim, 1820 [= homopsis semenov, 1893 syn. Nov.], earophanta semenov, 1903. These genera are distributed in almost all large deserts of palaearctic asia: karakum, kyzylkum, muyunkum, taklamakan, gobi, registan, dasht-e-kawir, dasht-e-lut, as well as in other arid and semi-arid sandy landscapes from european russia to the south of eastern siberia. The group of platyopoid genera is polyphyletic. We propose at least two monophyletic branches: the habrobates genus group (the first four genera mentioned above), which represents the subtribe habrobatina nabozhenko \& s. Chigray subtrib. Nov. And the platyope genus group (latter four genera) within the nominotypical subtribe. A new species is described from pakistan (balochistan): dietomorpha gonzalesi s. Chigray \& nabozhenko sp. Nov. Platyope granulata fischer von waldheim, 1820 is recorded for kazakhstan for the first time. The following synonymy is resurrected: apatopsis grombczewskii semenov, 1890 = apatopsis conradti semenov, 1890, syn. Resurr. Two new combinations resulting from the synonymy of genera are given: habrobates gabrieli schuster, 1935 comb. Nov. (From kawiria), platyope grumi semenov, 1893 comb. Nov. (From homopsis). Lectotypes are designated for the following taxa: apatopsis grombczewskii (semenov, 1891), apatopsis conradti semenov, 1891, habrochiton vernus semenov-tjan-shansky, 1907, habrobates vernalis semenov, 1903, kawiria gabrieli schuster, 1935, platyope dilatata reitter, 1887; mantichorula semenowi reitter, 1889, mantichorula grandis semenov, 1893, homopsis grumi semenov, 1893, platyope serrata semenov, 1893, platyope planidorsis reitter, 1889, platyope tomentosa semenov, 1893. Additional information for type specimens studied by the authors is given for habrochiton primaeveris semenov-tjan-shansky, 1907 (holotype), habrobates vejisovi kelejnikova, 1977, platyope ordossica semenov-tjan-shansky, 1907 (holotype), earophanta autumnalis semenov, 1903 (holotype, junior synonym of e. Planidorsis reitter, 1889), earophanta loudoni semenov, 1903 (holotype, junior synonym of earophanta pilosissima reitter, 1895), earophanta pubescens skopin, 1960 (holotype, paratypes), earophanta beludzhistana bogatchev, 1957 (holotype).

ABSTRACT:
The relationship between the genera colasia koch, 1965 and belousovia medvedev, 2007 within the tribe blaptini is discussed, and a new synonymy is proposed: belousovia medvedev, 2007, syn. Nov. Of colasia koch, 1965. As a result, three new combinations are established: colasia helenae (medvedev, 2007), comb. Nov., c. Kabaki intermedia (medvedev, 2007), comb. Nov., and c. Kabaki kabaki (medve-dev, 2007), comb. Nov. Colasia akisoides koch, 1965 is redescribed, and a lectotype is designated. Three new species of the genus colasia are described and illustrated from china: c. Bijica sp. Nov. (Guizhou), c. Medvedevi sp. Nov. (Yunnan), and c. Pilosa sp. Nov. (Yunnan). A distribution map and a key to species of the revised genus colasia are presented.

ABSTRACT:
The duration of the vegetative period is an important agronomic characteristic of cereal crops. It is mainly influenced by the vrn (response to vernalization) and ppd (response to photoperiod) genes. In this work, we searched for alleles of several known genes of these two systems of response to external conditions in 15 accessions of aegilops tauschii coss. (Syn. Ae. Squarrosa l.), with the aim of studying the impact these alleles have on the vegetative period duration and growth habit. As a result, three allelic variants have been found for the vrn-d1 gene: (i) one intact (winter type), (ii) one with a 5437 bp deletion in the first intron and (iii) one previously undescribed allele with a 3273 bp deletion in the first intron. It has been shown that the spring growth habit of ae. Tauschii can be developed due to the presence of a new allele of the vrn-d1 gene. Significant differences in expression levels between the new allelic variant of the vrn-d1 gene and the intact allele vrn-d1 were confirmed by qpcr. The new allele can be introgressed into common wheat to enhance the biodiversity of the spring growth habit and vegetative period duration of plants.

ABSTRACT:
Polymorphism of gliadins was investigated in aegilops tauschii from primary habitats ``4'' near hily, and ``6'' near rukel, in dagestan, russia 205 individual plants were analysed (53/50 and 54/48 plants of subsp. Tauschii/subsp. Strangulata from the habitats ``4'' and ``6'' respectively) and 1/7 and 18/14 different haplotypes were found among the plants of subsp. Tauschii/subsp. Strangulata from the habitats ``4'' and ``6'' respectively. No direct evidences of cross-pollination were pointed out, although gliadins electrophoretic phenotypes obtained allowed to suggest that it occur in ae. Tauschii with very low frequency. The data obtained revealed that during ae. Tauschii evolutionary history a local habitat could be populated many times by different phylogenetic lineages of the species. It was found that in dagestan, at the very edge of the species area, several different lineages belonging to different subspecies could for a long time co-exist together in a local habit, and in such case a very high level of genetic variation in ae. Tauschii could be accumulated on a square of less than one hectare. The further studies of genetic variation in ae. Tauschii local populations, based on molecular genetic methods seems to be very prospective for understanding of peculiarities of the species evolution.

ABSTRACT:
Local grape cultivars from different countries of the world are an important part of the gene pool of this culture. Of particular interest are the genotypes of the most ancient regions of viticulture. The territories of the subtropical zone of georgia and the central part of abkhazia belong to one of the centers of origin of the cultural grapevine. The purpose of the work was to genotype native abkhazian grape cultivars, to study their genetic diversity based on dna profiling data and to compare them with the genotypes of local varieties of other viticultural regions. Samples of plants were taken on the territory of the republic of abkhazia in private farmsteads and in the collection of the agricultural firm ``vina i vody abkhazii'' (''wines and waters of abkhazia'').The genotyping of the abkhazian cultivars avasirhva, agbizh, azhapsh, azhizhkvakva, azhikvaca, atvizh, atyrkuazh, achkykazh, kachich was carried out using 14 dna markers, 9 of which are standard microsatellite markers recommended for the identification of grape varieties. To improve our knowledge about the sizes of the identified alleles, we used the dna of grape cultivars with a known allelic composition at the analyzed loci. Statistical analysis of the data showed that the observed heterozygosity for the analyzed loci exceeded expected values, which indicates a genetic polymorphism of the studied sample of varieties. Evaluation of genetic similarity within the analyzed group based on the results of genotyping at 14 loci showed that the cultivars kachich and azhapsh differed from the other abkhazian varieties. The obtained dna profiles of the abkhazian cultivars were checked for compliance with dna-fingerprints of grape varieties in the vitis international variety catalogue. The georgian varieties azhizhkvakva and tsitska turned out to be synonyms according to dna profiles, two varieties from the database (italian albana bianca and georgian ojaleshi) have differences in dna fingerprints from the varieties atyrkuazh and azhikvatsa only in one allele, respectively. When comparing the identified abkhazian grape genotypes, their difference from the sample of dagestan, don, greek, turkish, italian, spanish, and french varieties and genetic similarity with the genotypes of georgian grapes were shown.

ABSTRACT:
Recently, the importance of studying the biodiversity of the vitaceae juss family. Increases markedly, while new data appear on the gene pool of cultivated and wild-growing grapes vitis vinifera l. Modern methods of analyzing the polymorphism of populations of grape plants, both wild-growing and cultural, are actively used. According to the literature, a number of studies have been conducted in the russian federation to study native varieties and wild forms of grapes in the crimea, dagestan, along the banks of the don and other regions, but there is very little information about kuban wild and ancient forms of grapes. The article presents the results of a study of wild forms of the genus vitis l., growing in places of ancient human settlements on the territory of the utrish state nature reserve of the krasnodar territory. For the first time, ampelographically and genetically samples of isolated populations of wild grapes growing on the territory of the utrish state nature reserve have been studied and described. Several habitats of wild grapes, presumably belonging to the vitis vinifera ssp species, have been studied. Silvestris gmel. Or its variants var. Tipica negr. - typically wild forest grapes. A detailed description of phytocenoses in which the studied plant forms grow is carried out. Ecological and geographical characteristics of their habitats are given. Samples were taken for further genetic analysis. Dna-marker analysis of plant genotypes by microsatellite loci vvmd27, vvmd5, vs2, vrzag79 recommended for genotyping of grapes was performed. It was shown that some of the samples are polymorphic to each other, while others are genetically close. When analyzing genotypes, rare alleles were detected for the analyzed ssr loci.

ABSTRACT:
The fertility indices of the main soil types of the tersk-sulak lowland used in irrigated husbandry are considered. Intensive anthropogenic impacts on irrigated soils result in a decrease in their fertility. Agriculture is conducted with a negative balance of humus and nourishing elements in handle soils. The dependence of productivity on the humus content, adsorptive capacity, granulometric composition and extent of soil salinization is established.

ABSTRACT:
Materials are presented for route, stationary soil, and ecological studies carried out in the high-mountainous zone of dagestan with the characteristics of (a) the modern features of the development of the soil cover and (b) the ecological parameters of the soil cover and their changes under the influence of climatic warming. The variety of natural and economic conditions of the object of study resulted in significant diversity of the soil cover. The soil distribution was greatly influenced by the terrain height and the exposure and steepness of slopes. Based on soil erosion studies from previous periods, it can be noted that improper land use and climatic warming have led to radical changes in the composition of the soil cover in terms of defining indicators-soil erosion. In recent years, the area of eroded land has doubled, and the area with heavily eroded soils has increased by a third. This led to a decrease in the thickness of humus horizons in almost all soils to an average of 20 cm, and the loss of humus reserves in soils amounted to 60\% of the original content. The presented analysis of soil-cover degradation and the established patterns of soil evolution on the slope lands of high mountains serve as a theoretical basis for the reproduction of soil fertility and preservation of the ecological role of soil protection from erosion and other degradation processes.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. Determination of phytocenosis productivity, nitrogen concentration and reserves in blocks of plant associations and by soil types in the north-western precaspian region of russia. Methods. Comprehensive research on the accumulation of organic matter and nitrogen in five blocks of plant matter, six plant associations and three types of soil by season using well-known methods of accounting and analysis of soils and plants.results. The regularities of phytomass formation, changes in nitrogen concentration and reserves in the main soil types and six plant associations for the 2011-2018 seasons were revealed. Conclusions. Ephemeroid-wormwood-cereal, ephemeroid-wormwood, cereal-wormwood, forb-campfire and mixed-grass-campfire plant communities formed on light chestnut soil are the most productive, with a total productivity of 24.34 t/ha. The maximum nitrogen concentration was observed in the cereal-wormwood, wormwood-saltwort, forb-saltwort and cereal-saltwort associations - 1.9, 1.97, 2.2, and 2.57\%, respectively, which is due to the predominance of artemisia taurica willd., artemisia lercheana web.ex stechm. And salsola iberica sennen \& pau. In associations where there are representatives of the poaceae, brassicaceae and caryophyllaceae, nitrogen decreases to 1.72-1.74\%. Its value was higher on light-chestnut soil, being 1.82\% of absolutely dry mass, while on meadow-chestnut soil it decreased to 1.75 and on saline soil is typically 1.38\%. In the root mass of plant associations, its indicators were 3.2 times less than in the above ground mass. Nitrogen reserves by blocks of plant matter formed the following decreasing series: roots >\_ green mass >\_ rags >\_ felt. In the input part of the balance in plant associations, 171.6 nitrogen accumulates on light-chestnut soil, 63.1 on meadow-chestnut soil, 49.1 kg/ha on automorphic typical saline soil, and 171.9; 64.3 and 58.1 kg/ha in the expenditure part, respectively. The balance of nitrogen in the first type of soil is formed with a minimum deficit of 0.6 kg/ha, 1.2 and 9 kg/ha, respectively.

ABSTRACT:
The qualitative composition and quantitative content of mineral substances in the soils and fruits of prunus armeniaca l. And malus domestica borkh. Cultivated in the environmental conditions of the plains and foothills of central daghestan has been estimated. The adaptation of apricot and apple trees to the natural factors of the lower foothills results in higher sugar concentrations in their fruits in comparison with trees growing on plains; the apricot and apple trees growing on lower foothills concentrate more ca and p, while the contents of k, na, mg, and cu in their fruits are reduced. Plants of the same species growing on soils with different contents of mineral substances differ by the total content of macro-and microelements in their fruits but accumulate roughly equivalent levels of p, na, ca, cu, ni, and pb.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. To reveal the basic patterns and principles of formation on the surface of crusty solonchak of an aeolian-accumulative horizon and its positive transformation at the taxonomic level. Material and methods. On the surface of crusty solonchak there is formed a layer of silt-sand fractions with seeds of wild phytocenoses which move/(sic) over the surface of the soil under the influence of atmospheric processes with the utilization of wood. Material protruding above the soil surface to 0.2 m. Analyses, surveys and observations were carried out of the key parts (for investigation - under the aeolian layer) of the crusty solonchak transformed through the dynamics of humidity, lowering of soil moisture (sc), granulometric composition, chemistry and level of soil salinity, as well as determination of the species composition of the phytocenoses and the accumulation of phytomass by plants. Results. The possibility was revealed of a positive transformation within eight years of a layer of silt-sand fractions with seeds of wild phytocenoses in the w-ael humus horizon with a capacity of 5 cm +/- 0.8 cm and containing 1.26\% of humus. The type of salinization remains sulphate-chloride but the level of salinization decreases from very strong in the 0-5 layer to weak one in the 6-15 cm layer - on average. The profile of the crusty solonchak c-k(k)[aj(k) - aj,s - bca,s - cca,s] is changed to that of regraded solonchak c-k(w) [w-ael - aj,s - bca,s - cca,s]. The granulometric composition of the soil is improved and a productive phytocenosis is formed. Conclusion. The positive transformation of crusty solonchak to regraded contributes to the reduction of soil deflation and of aerial contamination by dust particle fractions, the lowering of carbon emissions from the soil and of the natural greenhouse effect, the increase of the utilization coefficient of photosynthetically active radiation (par) and the prevention of excessive overheating of the soil and atmosphere.

ABSTRACT:
The paper reports the results of the first skeletochronological study of age structure and distinguishing characteris-tics of growth in the triploid toad bufotes baturae, inhabitant of sasyk-bulak hot spring in the pamir mountains (3797 m a.s.l.). Minimal and maximum ages of males of the species were three and seven years, respectively. The age of females ranged from three to six years. Mean age for both sexes was 4.0 years. The majority of males (46.2\%) were three years old, most females (58.8\%) were four years old. The age of sexual maturity was reached after three hibernations (46\% in males and 24\% in females). The majority of toads breed once at the age of three or four years. Only few (18\% in females and 23\% in males) individuals in this population were older. Harsh high-alti-tude cold desert conditions and limited food resources may cause high mortality of the toads. The correlation be-tween the minimal age at sexual maturity and the degree of dryness of climate was demonstrated among species of the genus bufotes. As a rule, toads which live in more humid climatic conditions mature earlier. Perhaps, this ex-plains that substantial part of semi-aquatic individuals of b. Baturae in the hot spring mature at earlier age (3 years) than other polyploid species (4 - 5 years) that inhabit arid environments. In both sexes of b. Baturae, growth rate was similar to that of other closely related high-mountain species, diploid b. Latastii and triploid b. Pseudoraddei.

ABSTRACT:
The paper provides the first data about age structure and growth of the zamda toad, bufotes zamdaensis (boulenger, 1882), from the himachal pradesh state (india). The study of age structure of toads was carried out using skeletochronology. The minimal and maximal ages in males of b. Zamdaensis were 4 and 7 years, respectively, with mean age of 5.4 years. The majority of males (60\%) were 5 years old. The age in females ranged from 5 to 9 years with mean value of 6.1 years. The majority of females (71\%) were 5 - 6 years old. Males of b. Zamdaensis can reach maturation after four winterings and females after five winterings. Unlike closely related species b. Latastii, the growth rate in both sexes does not decrease significantly after the 1st and 2nd wintering and remains high after the 3rd and 4th wintering.

ABSTRACT:
The histological structure and clinical blood parameters of mature female and male beaked redfish, sebastes mentella, from the pelagic zone of the irminger sea, northeast atlantic allowed for the first time to describe the features of the morphological structure of their bodies and to present the characteristics of blood cells. The diameter of white and red muscle fibers along the body (from head to tail) in females and males is significantly different. In addition, females differ from males in the distribution of fiber density along the body. The morphology and sizes of erythropoietic cells and leukocytes in females and males of the beaked redfish are similar to those of other fish species. However, erythropoiesis and leukopoiesis in males and females are not the same. Significant differences in the composition of the somatic muscles of females and males indicate a higher rate of metabolic processes in females. In the leukogram of females, the proportion of mature segmented neutrophils is significantly higher than that in males. Therefore, females have a higher cellular factor of innate immunity. Segmented neutrophils are the main microphages with high antigenic activity, providing phagacytosis due to defensin in lysosomes and performing direct killer actions.

ABSTRACT:
The hematological and cytochemical parameters of the peripheral blood of the spotted barracudina arctozenus risso and the sharpchin barracudina paralepis coregonoides (paralepididae) are studied for the first time from the materials of a survey in the irminger sea in 2018. It was shown that erythropoiesis in both fish species studied is approximately the same. Normoblasts and erythrocytes are present. The lymphoid character of the blood of both fish species was established by comparative analysis of leukograms. It was noted that a large proportion of mature segmented forms, i.e., neutrophils responsible for noncongenital nonspecific cellular immunity, is characteristic of sharpchin barracudina.

ABSTRACT:
The morphological and functional characteristics of the somatic musculature's histological structure have been studied for three species of deep-sea fish from the myctophidae family: spotted lanternfish myctophum punctatum, lancet fish notoscopelus kroyeri, and rakery beaconlamp lampanyctus macdonaldi. The average diameter of fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers in all studied species is large, and this indicator is highest in rakery beaconlamp. All species are characterized by a craniocaudal gradient of a decrease in the size of white muscle fibers. The shape of the fibers, from angular polygonal (spotted lanternfish) to the oval (rakery beaconlamp) and round (lancet fish), is a distinctive feature from other species of bony fish. In spotted lanternfish, a group of fibers of very small diameter, which are presumably small, slow-twitch oxidizing fibers, was also noted between the white and red muscles. The red muscles in the studied fish are poorly identified, since they are poorly developed. The studied species have a well-developed connective tissue carcass of white muscles, which indicates a certain friability of fast-twitch muscles. Both the red and white muscles in lanternfishes are a place of intense deposition of lipid reserves. Apparently, the high lipid content in muscle tissue helps to reduce the specific gravity of fish and increase their buoyancy.

ABSTRACT:
The results of hematological, cytochemical, and biochemical surveys for fish blood in the specimen ocellate river stingray potamotrygon motoro and two specimens of cat sharks including the halmahera epaulette shark hemiscyllium halmahera and the grey bambooshark chiloscyllium griseumare have been reported. A comparison in the parameters analyzed in the survey between the common carp cyprinus carpio, the wels catfish silurus glanis, and the sterlet acipenser ruthenus has been performed. A high percentage of eosinophils involved in antiparasite immunity in the cartilaginous fishes is recorded. A high content of cationic protein in lysosomes of neutrophils in these fish species can indicate a considerable potent phagocytic activity of the latter. A low amount of alanine aminotransferase in the analyzed shark and ray specimens compared to the bony fish was recorded, which indicate the strength of membranes in hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes.

ABSTRACT:
The hematological parameters of the peripheral blood of the atlantic chub mackerel scomber colias, bonito sarda sarda, and splendid alfonsino beryx splendens are presented based on materials of scientific monitoring on board the fishing vessels in the exclusive economic zones of morocco and mauritania in the years 2004-2017. A larger number of immature erythropoietic cells was recorded in the alfonsino, which is probably due to its possible vertical feeding migrations to greater depths with high pressure and low oxygen content. The analysis of erythropoiesis and the leukocyte formula revealed features of physiological and immunological aspects. Bonito has a higher monocyte content than atlantic chub mackerel and alfonsino, which indicates a high level of innate cellular immunity, represented by phagocytosis.

ABSTRACT:
Materials of the histostructure and clinical parameters of the blood of sexually mature females and males of the beaked redfish (sebastes mentella) from the pelagial zone of the irminger sea (northeastern atlantic) made it possible for the first time to describe the features of the morphological structure of the body and present the characteristics of blood cells. The diameter of white and red muscle fibers along the body (from head to tail) in females and males of the beaked redfish differs significantly. In addition, females differ from males in the distribution of the fiber density along the body. The morphology and size of erythropoietic cells and leukocytes in beaked females and males are similar to those of other fish species. Nevertheless, erythropoiesis and leukopoiesis of males and females proceed differently. Significant differences in the composition of the somatic muscles of females and males indicate a higher rate of metabolic processes in females. In the leukogram of females, the proportion of mature segmented neutrophils, which are the main microphages with high antigenic activity, is significantly higher than in males. Therefore, females have a higher cellular factor of innate immunity.

ABSTRACT:
Genetic variation between different populations of puccinia triticina from russia and kazakhstan was evaluated, based on 18 simple sequence repeat (ssr) markers. Seventeen collections of p. Triticina (181 single-uredinial isolates, in total) obtained from 15 different host species belonging to aegilops and triticum were included in the study. All single-uredinial isolates were obtained from naturally infected plants in experimental fields in dagestan (caucasus region of russia), novosibirsk (west siberian region of russia) and shortandy (northern kazakhstan). Regional differentiation of p. Triticina ssr genotypes was detected. Collections from host plants with the same ploidy and/or genetically similar background were genetically similar. Collections from the hexaploid species in dagestan were highly similar to those from common wheat. Collections from tetraploid species t. Aethiopinum, t. Turaninum, t. Dicoccum (genome bd'a(u)a(u)) from dagestan were moderately different from the collections originated from the hexaploid species. Puccinia triticina from ae. Crassa ((ddmm)-d-c-m-c) collected in dagestan was genetically similar to populations from common wheat and other hexaploid species. Collections from ae. Tauschii (2n = 2x = 14) were significantly different from those obtained from tetraploid (2n = 4x =28) and hexaploid (2n = 6x =42) host species collected on the experimental field in dagestan. Ssr genotypes of p. Triticina isolates from t. Durum in kazakhstan were highly dissimilar to those sampled from all other hosts. A low association was established between the ssr genotypes of p. Triticina identified in the present study and the virulence phenotypes for the same set of collections, as observed in a previous study.

ABSTRACT:
Virulence of 347 single-uredinial isolates of puccinia triticina from 16 species of aegilops and triticum grown in experimental fields with natural inoculum in dagestan (caucasus region of russia) and novosibirsk (west siberian region of russia) and in an artificially inoculated field in shortandy (northern kazakhstan) was analyzed with 20 near-isogenic wheat differential lines. All isolates were avirulent to lr9, lr19, and lr24, and virulent to lr11, lr14a, lr17a, and lr30 genes. The p. Triticina isolates varied for virulence on resistance genes lr1, lr2a, lr2b, lr2n, lr3a, lr3bg, lr3ka, lr14b, lr15, lr16, lr18, lr20, and lr26. Forty virulence phenotypes of p. Triticina were identified, of which seven virulence phenotypes were shared by at least two hosts. The virulence analysis revealed differences between p. Triticina from diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid species of wheat. Collections from the hexaploid species in dagestan were more similar to those from common wheat. Isolates from tetraploid species were less virulent. Asian isolates (novosibirsk and northern kazakhstan) originating from common wheat and t. Dicoccum were more virulent than those from caucasus.

ABSTRACT:
Yellow (stripe) rust, caused by puccinia striiformis f. Sp. Tritici (pst), is a major disease of common wheat worldwide. Disease epidemics in russia have been frequent and destructive, mostly in the north caucasus. However, over the last 5 years, the significance of pst has markedly increased in other russian regions. Therefore, the pst virulence diversity was investigated in triticum aestivum in six geographically distant regions of the european (north caucasus, north-west, low volga, central black earth region, and volga-vyatka) and asian (west siberia) parts of russia, with strongly different climates, environmental conditions, and growing wheat genotypes. Seventy-nine virulence pathotypes among 117 isolates were identified using the 12 avocet yr gene lines (yr1, yr5, yr6, yr7, yr8, yr9, yr10, yr15, yr17, yr24, yr27, and yrsp) and eight supplemental wheat differentials (heines vii, vilmorin 23, hybrid 46, strubes dickkopf, carstens v, suwon 92/omar, nord desprez, and heines peko). Only four pathotypes occurred in two or more regions. High variability was detected within pst populations from dagestan, central, north-west, and west siberia that postulated to form an intrapopulation subdivision of each of them into several subgroups. Most regional virulence groups of pathotypes were closely related, except for several small subgroups of pathotypes from west siberia, dagestan, north-west, and central european regions. All pst isolates were avirulent in lines with yr5, yr10, yr15, and yr24 genes. Virulence to yr17 was detected for several isolates of two pathotypes, one each from the north-west and low volga regions. Variation in virulence frequency was observed in other differential lines.

ABSTRACT:
A collection of puccinia triticina isolates was characterized for polymorphism of microsatellite loci and estimated for their differentiation by geographic origin. The collection included 20 isolates from the ural region, 31 from west siberia, 53 from central europe, 32 from the northwest region, 32 from the volga region, and 40 from the north caucasus (24 from dagestan and 16 from krasnodar and stavropol). The studied isolates were represented by 65 virulence phenotypes. In the polymorphism analysis of 18 microsatellite loci, 69 genotypes were determined. The index values of genetic distances (fst, rst, kbc) between populations for microsatellite loci indicated differentiation of p. Triticina isolates according to geographical origin, and they were clustered into three groups: (1) asian, (2) european, and (3) north caucasian. The north caucasian isolates from krasnodar and stavropol regions were closer in similarity to european isolates than the dagestan ones. Current analysis confirmed the assumption made earlier on the basis of the virulence analysis about the existence of several geographic fungi populations in russia.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. The aim of the research was to improve the elements of agro-technology for cultivating new high-yielding varieties of winter wheat under conditions of the plain zone irrigation depending on the doses and the terms of introducing mineral nitrogen-phosphorus fertilizers. Methods. Research was carried out on chestnut heavy loamy soils. Sampling of soils and plants, as well as agro-chemical properties of soils were determined according to standard generally accepted methods. Mathematical processing of data on the yield of cereals was carried out by analysis-of-variance method using computer technology. Results. Our studies showed that the most productive of the studied varieties was grom, which, on average for three years (2012-2015) gave a grain yield of 7.6 t/ha with nitrogen-phosphorus fertilizers introduced at a dose of n180p100 against 5.6 t/ha in a similar version to the control during sowing of the tanya variety. Vassa and sila varieties were also inferior to grom variety for yields, respectively, by 1.1 t/ha and 1.4 t / ha. It was also revealed that with the grom variety, when applying an increased dose of mineral fertilizers (n180p100), on average for three years, the best indicators were by the area of the leaf surface (63.6 thousand m(2)/ha), photosynthetic index of crops was 2765.6 thousand m(2)/ha and net productivity of photosynthesis was 6.3 g/m(2), day. For other varieties of winter wheat and doses of mineral fertilizers, these indicators were lower. Conclusion. In steady-state experiment, when studying the potential of new high-yielding varieties of winter wheat at different levels and times of introducing mineral nutrition, the grom variety showed the best yields.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. The aim of the research was to identify the effect of types of fertilizer on increasing soil fertility and corn yield of grain and sorghum in conditions of irrigation of the tersko-sulak subprovince. Methods. Carrying out some field experiments: conducting observations and laboratory tests, selection of soil and plant samples was carried out according to generally accepted methods: statistical processing of yield data was carried out by the method of variance analysis based on kirov federal state unitary enterprise and fsbsi dagestan agricultural research institute named after f.g. Kisriev. Results. Studies showed that in the post-harvest period after harvesting winter wheat, it is better to cultivate green manure with the presence of legumes. A valuable biological feature of them is the ability to absorb atmospheric nitrogen. The powerful root system of the seeding pea improves the physical properties of the soil, as well as microbiological activity. The most favorable conditions are created for the growth and development of maize and sorghum, after plowing of fertilizers in the stubble period in the conditions of irrigation of the tersko-sulak subprovince, by applying mineral fertilizers at a dose of n-150 p-75 k-75, seeding peas, manure (30 t / ha), in these cases, on average, over two years, the highest yield of maize was 5.6-5.7-5.5 t / ha and grain sorghum, respectively, 4.7-4.8-4.5 t / ha. Conclusion. For the first time, in conditions of irrigation of the tersko-sulak subprovince, were obtained the results on the effectiveness of different types of fertilizers introduced into the soil.

ABSTRACT:
The physical properties of plowed and fallow chestnut and meadow-chestnut soils were studied in the terek-sulak plain. It is shown that soil density depends both on the aggregate size and specific features of the soil formation process. In each particular case, this dependence is closely linked to the soil genesis and agricultural use. Analysis of the aggregate porosity estimated based on the percentage content of fractions shows that the major share of interaggregate porosity is attributed to large aggregates. The results can be extrapolated to other parts of the soil cover in the study area. On each studied site, an experimental soil profile cut was established, the morphological soil properties were described, and soil samples were taken layer by layer (cm) from horizons a, b-1, b-2, and c-1 (a(plow), arable layer) for chestnut soils and from horizons a, b-1, and c-1 for meadow-chestnut soils. The structure index was computed based on the the sifting data as the ratio between the sum of macroaggregates (0.25-10 mm in size) and the sum of aggregates with diameters of more than 10 mm and less than 0.25 mm. The porosity of aggregate fractions 7-5, 5-3, 3-2, 2-1, 1-0.5, and 0.5-0.25 mm in size was determined from randomly selected samples of the respective fractions. Mechanical sampling was used to ensure the random selection of samples for analysis. In all of studied soils, the porosity of aggregates of the same size decreases down the profile. The sharpest decrease is observed in large (7-5 mm) aggregates: their porosity drops from 37\% in horizon a to 31\% in horizon c-1. In small aggregates, this trend is manifested not so clearly. In chestnut soils, aggregate porosity gradually decreases with depth, while the minimum porosity in meadow-chestnut soils is observed in the b-1 and c-1 horizons. This pattern is manifested most clearly in aggregates 2-1 mm in size. However, the minimum aggregate porosity in horizon b-1 is pronounced quite clearly not only in the 2-1 mm fraction but also in all other fractions up to 7-5 mm in size. In the c-1 horizon, the aggregate porosity drops to almost identical values that are close to the computed close-packed porosity (a method involving mutual coupling of mineral particles in a clastic rock). Earlier studies have shown that aggregate porosity is closely linked to the soil composition, structure, and origin, as well as the general soil genesis that determines the fertility.

ABSTRACT:
White clover populations collected from the caucasus region and eastern turkey were compared with seven white clover cultivars in a moist, lowland, highly fertile environment. The caucasus collection came from 15 sites below 1000 m and 19 sites above 1000 m; all seven sites in turkey were above 1000 m. The populations were generally small leaved and except for those from low altitude sites in dagestan and azerbaijan populations were acyanogenic. None of the collected populations were significantly higher yielding than `grassland huia' in any season. However, several populations from the caucasus were higher yielding than `kent wild white' and similar to that of `grassland tahora.' Survival was poor with only four populations having more than 50\% of plants surviving after 18 months in this environment. High altitude caucasus populations were earlier flowering than low altitude populations, an adaptation to allow adequate seed set. There was a negative relationship between altitude of population origin and proportion of cyanogenic plants; and between altitude and both leaf size and canopy height. High incidence of no leaf mark (vv) was associated with populations from colder rather than warmer environments. Populations from sites with low rainfall were larger leaved and more upright than populations from wetter sites. Populations from severely grazed sites were less upright and less cyanogenic than populations from infrequently or nil defoliated sites.

ABSTRACT:
The article presents the results of a study on the content of arsenic, lead, cadmium and mercury in water, soil and in plant products that are directly used by humans for nutrition. During four years of observation, water analysis demonstrates high arsenic concentrations. The arsenic content ranges from 0.033 to 0.048 mclkg versus 0.01 mac and exceeds almost 3.3-5 times. Lead content exceeds 10 times. In the course of the research, it was found that artesian water is the source of arsenic contamination of plant foods with arsenic. For many years, artesian water has been used by the population to irrigate cultivated plants. Arsenic is intensively accumulated by many plants: 9 out of 20 have its concentration above the maximum permissible. It was found that the most actively absorb and accumulate arsenic figs, potatoes and cucumber. The high content of lead is dominated in parsley, dill and watercress salad. All detected elements have a cumulative and toxic effect and are carcinogenic and belong to the first class of danger. Arsenic is a substance that has both carcinogenic and pronounced general toxic effects. With this in mind, scientists have identified correlations between oncological disease and the use of water containing elevated concentrations of arsenic as sources (alissa, ferns, 2011; gasanguseinava, 2010; 2018 putilova, 2006; ashurbekova et al., 2018). Comparison of the results of artesian water studies used in the terek-kumsky basin for domestic water supply, conducted earlier at the institute of geology, dsc of ras, and the results of our research show that the constant chemical composition of artesian water remains, the arsenic content exceeds the maximum permissible concentrations of who average 10.0 - 20.0 times, according to gost - an average of 1.8-2.0 times.

ABSTRACT:
The phase equilibria of immiscible binary systems (water-n-hexane, water-n-pentane) are investigated using a constant-volume piezometer. The measurements were performed under normal conditions, based on p,v,t,x-data obtained in the temperature range of 300-680 k, pressures up to 60 mpa, and in a wide range of densities. Based on the experimental data, we constructed phase diagrams in the p-t and t-x coordinates and determined the krichevskii parameters for the system of water-n-hexane near the critical point of the pure solvent.

ABSTRACT:
This paper studies ethnic differences in the fertility of the descendants of migrants in a highly polyethnic region of russia, dagestan (north caucasus). That region gives a rather rare example of an urban population whose majority is formed by migrants and their second - and third-generation descendants of several ethnicities which differ in fertility in their rural places of origin. We take the opportunity to consider the key hypotheses on the fertility of the descendants of migrants in this rather non-standard setting. The central question we address is whether the ethnic differences in fertility observed among rural residents are also passed on to descendants of rural-to-urban migrants. Another question concerns the role of education in preserving vs. Weakening ethnic differences in fertility between descendants of migrants. We analyze the russian population census 2010 data on the region under study, running poisson models for the total number of children and logistic models for progressions to different parities. Our main conclusion is that ethnic differences in fertility remain significant among descendants of rural-to-urban migrants. Arguably, this supports the socialization hypothesis, because contacts between co-ethnics are intensive in the region and interethnic marriages are rather infrequent, which helps young urban people to adopt patterns of reproductive behavior typical for their ethnicity. Among highly educated women, however, the ethnic differences in fertility are weaker, which might be related to the ease in the departure of such women from fertility trajectories of their co-ethnics.

ABSTRACT:
Aim. The unique gene pool of indigenous breeds in the dagestan caucasus is threatened by the increasingly widespread use of commercial breeds, which in turn risks narrowing the genetic base necessary to increase and maintain existing genetic diversity. For this reason, our research aimed to study the polymorphism of the prl, pit-1, gh genes in red steppe and caucasian brown cattle raised in the conditions of dagestan. Methods. Genotyping of red steppe and caucasian brown cattle was carried out using pcr-rflp methods. Using these methods, genetic analysis was carried out and polymorphism of the prolactin, somatotropin and pituitary-specific transcription factor genes was studied. Results. As a result of the genotyping of an experimental group of red steppe cattle, it was found that the distribution of two alleles and three genotypes (pit-1a and pit-1b; pit-1aa, pit-1bb, pit-1ab) of the pit-1 gene has a specific character. The specificity of the allelic spectrum of the prl gene is expressed in the high (0.84) frequency of occurrence of the prla allele and low (0.16) frequency of the prlb allele. This is reflected in the presence of homo- and heterozygous genotypes with a frequency of occurrence of 73.0; 23.0; 4.0 \%, respectively. Conclusion. Applied genetic approaches to improve the productive and breed qualities of livestock, which are modern and based on a more complete analysis of the genetic diversity and genotype of the studied populations, contribute to the conservation of zoned breeds. At the same time, intrapopulation variability and good adaptability should ensure the sustainable development of dairy cattle breeding in various climatic zones.

ABSTRACT:
The supplementary description of the oribatid mite species discoppia (cylindroppia) cylindrica (perez-inigo, 1965) (oribatida, oppiidae) is presented, based on materials collected from deep layers of coastal sandy soils in the republic of dagestan, eastern caucasus. The morphology of exobothridial seta, gnathosoma and ovipositor, and the identification of leg setae and solenidia are given for the first time for this species. The revised generic diagnosis, identification key, distribution, and habitats of all known representatives of discoppia balogh, 1983 are presented. Some taxonomic nuances within discoppia are discussed, resulting in the following proposals: oppia bifidus bayoumi and al-khalifa, 1985 is a junior synonym of d. (C.) Cylindrica; oppia agricola fujikawa, 1982 is not synonym of d. (C.) Cylindrica and transferred to the genus microppia balogh, 1983; oppia tenuis hammer, 1958 is not representative of discoppia; discoppia (cylindroppia) rostroincisa subias and rodriguez, 1986 n. Stat. (Instead of the existing subspecies status). Together with d. (C.) Cylindrica, in the same samples, two rare oppiidae species were found: oxyoppia (oxyoppiella) minuscula hugo-coetzee, lotfollahi, abbasi-kalo and movahedzade, 1917 (known only from the open habitats in iran) is first recorded in russia; graptoppia (stenoppia) boucheri ermilov and frolov, 2021 (known from passalid beetles collected in ghana and gabon, west africa) is first found in the palaearctic. Both findings in dagestan are among the northernmost records of their semicosmopolitan subgenera.
