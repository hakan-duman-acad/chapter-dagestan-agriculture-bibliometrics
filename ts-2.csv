OUR INVESTIGATION OF 18 KEY VILLAGES IN THE NORTH CAUCASUS REPUBLICS OF KARACHAY-CHERKESSIA, KABARDINO-BALKARIA, NORTH OSSETIA, INGUSHETIA, CHECHNYA AND DAGESTAN SHOW THAT LAND REFORMS HAVE GALVANISED MULTIPLE ACTORS REPRESENTING THE STATE, AS WELL AS COLLECTIVES, INDIVIDUALS AND VARIOUS FORMAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS THAT REGULATE RELATIONS BETWEEN THESE ACTORS. ALONG WITH THE POLITICAL FACTORS -SUCH AS THE LEVEL OF CENTRALISATION AND ECONOMIC LIBERALISATION - THAT HAVE LED TO DIFFERENCES IN THE PACE OF LAND REFORMS, LOCAL NATURAL AND CULTURAL CONDITIONS AND COMMUNITIES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE. THE LATTER ARE CHARACTERISED EITHER BY CONSERVATISM OR BY READINESS FOR REFORMS. REGARDING THE KEY VILLAGES, FIVE DIFFERENT TYPES WERE IDENTIFIED: 1) VILLAGES WHERE MOST OF THE LAND HAS BEEN REDISTRIBUTED AMONG PRIVATE OWNERS (KARACHAY-CHERKESSIA); 2) VILLAGES THAT HAVE PRESERVED COLLECTIVE USE (SOME SETTLEMENTS IN THE NORTH CAUCASUS WITH MAINLY RUSSIAN POPULATION); 3) VILLAGES WHERE ACCESS TO LAND IS REGULATED BY THE STATE (CHECHNYA); 4) VILLAGES WHERE ACCESS TO LAND IS REGULATED BY MUNICIPAL BUREAUCRACY AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL (MANY OTHER REGIONS IN THE NORTH CAUCASUS); AND 5) VILLAGES WHERE THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO LAND IS IN DISPUTE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE BUSINESS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES (E.G. VILLAGES IN THE TOURIST AREAS OF THE NORTH CAUCASUS)."
NA,A PERFECT <I>UMMA</I>? HOW ETHNICITY SHAPES THE ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION OF DAGESTAN'S JIHADIST GROUPS,10.1177/1468796817700933,WOS000432063300007,"DRAWING ON UNIQUE INTERVIEWS WITH FORMER JIHADISTS FROM RUSSIA'S AUTONOMOUS REPUBLIC OF DAGESTAN, THIS ARTICLE IS THE FIRST TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF ETHNICITY ON JIHADIST GROUPS' METHODS OF ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY IN TERMS OF THEIR TARGET SELECTION, LOCAL SUPPORT, AND RECRUITMENT AND LEADERSHIP POLICIES. IT DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN LARGELY MONOETHNIC RURAL JAMAATSOR JIHADIST GROUPSAND MULTIETHNIC URBAN JAMAATS, POINTING TO THE CONTESTED NATURE OF ETHNICITY, PARTICULARLY IN THE LATTER GROUP. IT EXAMINES THE STEPS TAKEN BY THE LEADERSHIP OF URBAN JAMAATS TO OVERCOME ETHNIC CLEAVAGES AND AVOID INTERETHNIC TENSION BOTH WITHIN THE JIHADISTS' RANKS AND WITH REGARD TO THE LOCAL POPULATION. THE ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES THAT, AS A DIVISIVE PHENOMENON IN MULTIETHNIC URBAN JAMAATS, ETHNIC IDENTITY HAS BEEN DELIBERATELY DOWNPLAYED BY THE LEADERSHIP OF THESE GROUPS AT THE EXPENSE OF STRENGTHENING SUPRA-ETHNIC SALAFI-JIHADIST IDENTITY. THE ARTICLE ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ETHNIC IDENTITY IN JIHADIST GROUPS, IN SPITE OF IT BEING CONTRADICTORY TO SALAFI-JIHADIST DOCTRINE."
